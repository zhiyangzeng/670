This place was pretty good...I think Houston is lacking with really great thai food but this place is very interesting....Pretty much a Asian Grocery store with a small restaurant set up...I look forward to coming back to explore the menu more...I ordered the wings and the shrimp fried rice...Both were just ok...Next time I will plan to try one of the more tradtional thai dishes...Over all liked the vibe of this place...
