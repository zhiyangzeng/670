In early 2015, there was a lot of buzz about Asia Market being sold to a new owner, while the previous owners embarked on a new journey to open a stand-alone restaurant on the east side of I-45.  These articles made it seem like Asia Market would cease to exist as a grocery store/restaurant and just be a grocery store.  This is why I haven't been in months!!  Lo and behold, Asia Market is now "Asia Market Thai Lao Food," and THEY STILL SERVE THE SAME GREAT FOOD AT THE SAME PRICES!  I think the portions are now a normal size (as the portions seemed to get smaller and smaller with the previous owner).As a bonus, the new Asia Market is now open 7 days a week.  I visited on a Monday (the day Asia Market was previously closed), and the place was empty.  I feel bad if the new owners purchased under the premise that the place would be as busy as it once was.Anyway, I'm glad I discovered they still serve food.  Go support them!
