This place is a hidden gem. Just by looking at it from the outside, I would have never gone in if it wasn't for Yelp and a recommendation from a local. It's not the fanciest building, nor does it appear popular. I'm glad I did though because I found that it's a great place for a simple low-key lunch when you are craving cheap and delicious Thai food.Most items in the menu are under $10 and the portions are fair. We ordered the Seafood Panang Curry ($7.95) and Fried Seasoned Pork Spare Ribs ($7.95). Both dishes were delicious. The ribs came out piping hot and were flavorful. Be careful though because it will burn your mouth if you don't wait for them to cool down. My favorite was the Panang Curry. It had all the familiar full Thai flavors with just the right amount kick (medium spicy). With the price of $7.95, how can you beat that? Just add rice and you are set. We also ordered Thai tea for $2.50. It came in a large cup and was enough to share. This is a really good value for Thai tea considering how some other Thai places use a cup as narrow as a graduated cylinder (i.e. Thai Gourmet).There isn't much to say about the atmosphere. It's primarily a grocery store with a restaurant built in. They have tables and chairs set inside but not a whole lot so seating and is limited. We went during a busy lunch hour but we had no problems finding seating. You might have trouble finding parking though.Overall, this place is a low-key establishment that serves delicious Thai food at a fair price. I hope they don't change anything about this place or else I feel it would lose it's unique touch.
