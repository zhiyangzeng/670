We came here about 30 minutes before it closed, they decided to close shop early that day, so we could only order to-go. To compensate for this, the restaurant gave us 2 thai teas on the house. May I add this is one of my favorite thai tea place in Houston? As for the food:Thai tea - 5/5Pad Kee Mao - 4/5Lemon grass fried chicken nuggets -2/5 - too dry and salty, didn't taste as good as I imaginedThai spring roll - 3/5
