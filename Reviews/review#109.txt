I can't help myself. It's quick and close and it's my fix.The old Asia Market moved a few months back so I decided to try this "new" spot.The menu is similar (almost the same)My order: shrimp pad Thai, som tum (papaya salad- Laos style), small sticky rice and Thai ice tea. It was all good.The pad Thai was yummy and so was the som tum. Be careful on spice level. The som tum was spicier than normal (but I loved it). The Thai ice team was so delish too.The portions are better than the old Asia market which was a hit or miss on to go orders. And the new staff are super friendly. They did some renovation (and cleaning) so the inside is a bit nicer. Still carry groceries but a little more variety. They also have these yummy dessert sesame balls but it just depends on what day is it if they have it. I bought two and ate them before I even got in the car!!!!
