My first time was fantastic.   The staff was very friendly and talkative. I met a lovely couple who were so kind as to share their fish balls with me (which were delicious).   I chose the pad thai, just to be on the safe side and ordered it in the hot spice level. It was definitely spicy, but so deliciously worth it. The Pad Thai was fresh and flavorful and they give a very large portion. Over all I was extremely satisfied, I also ordered a side of sticky rice, which was also great.   Definitely going back again to try the curry.
