Ordered to-go from here last night.The store is pretty cool. I didn't get a chance to walk around it yet, but it seemed like a nifty grocery store I could use to shop for some of the dishes they cooked for us.The Panang curry was really good. It was spicy, but it wasn't a slap you in your face spice. It was subtle and kept building. The wife's Pad See Ew was pretty good as well, and they DO have tofu, though it's not on the menu.Quick, fast, efficient, and tasty. I'll definitely be back soon!
