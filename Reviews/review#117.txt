If you want Thai food and live in the Northside, you have to try out this place. It's really small and it's half Asian market/restaurant. Â To be honest it wasn't much of a dining area. The area to sit and eat is very small. So maybe to go the food. Owners are really nice and always love to hear how good their food is, which is really great. The curry and pad Thai were fresh and had loads of flavor. The prices are pretty decent too. Can't wait to come back.
