I really love Korean Noodle House! Their homemade kimchi is FANTASTIC (and unlimited)! I love the ice noodle soup here, spicy seafood soup, regular seafood soup, tofu jigae, and seafood pancake here. So, pretty much everything. :) The place is small (like a house), so seating is fairly limited. And try not to wear white if you order anything spicy- the stains are hard to get out!
