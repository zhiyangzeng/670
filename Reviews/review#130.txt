Tip: The Best Seafood Pancake in town!  The beef dumpling noodle soup is awesome! Only has kimchi for free appetizer.On a cold wet day we wanted noodle soup.  Korean was the first option.  First we started with a seafood pancake.  It is the Best i ever had!  Everyone raves about the kimchi.  Its good but im no expert.  I ate alot and enjoyed it but cant say it tasted much better than other kimchi.  Next the soups.  We had the seafood and the beef dumpling.   Seafood soup is tasty but the beef dumpling i thought was alot better.  The beef was very tender!  We also got the fried rice which i thought was just ok.  Place:  very small and fills up pretty quick.  About 13 tables.  It looks like an house that turned into a restaurant.  Wood floors and all that.  I love that!  Still pretty clean.  Service:  there are about 2-3 waiters and help.  They were pretty attentive and friendlyPrice:  very reasonable.
