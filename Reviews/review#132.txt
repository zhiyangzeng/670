Although Houston severely lacks in their K-town game, this place has got to be one of my favorites for Korean food. MMMmmm I am never disappointed with my visits, as their dishes are some of the most authentic I've had in Houston. Seafood Noodle Soup "Jjamppong Kalgooksoo" (5/5) - This is the only kalgooksoo I've had here. After the first time I ordered it, I couldn't bring myself to get anything else. See my photo for reference! The kimchi here is also soooo bomb, like I could eat the whole bowl of it as a meal on its own. Okay, maybe not, but you get the point. The downsides of Korean Noodle House would have to be the slow service and the cramped space. It may be difficult to find initially since it's literally a small house. It can get a little stuffy in there when the AC doesn't want to cooperate. I guess it just makes it that much homey.
