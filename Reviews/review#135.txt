I don't remember how many times I've came here but it has never failed me! I always come here with a group of friends and for starters we would always order a plate of fried shrimp/green onion pancake - big enough for everyone to try a piece. I've also tried their noodle soups, huge bowl.. Will definitely fill your belly up! And lastly, their soft tofu pots with rice are good but I've had better ones. PROS- Free Kimchi appetizer and refills- Price is average- Good service - Homey atmosphere CONS - Low number of tables- Gets crowded fast, so I would recommend going early if you have a big party! p.s. Free lollipop on they way out after checkout!
