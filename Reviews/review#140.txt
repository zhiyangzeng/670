WOW! This place's food is incredible! The flavor is so fresh and authentic-- I love it! The complimentary Kimchi appetizer is very, very spicy so beware!! However, it still has the most incredible spicy, garlicky, and tasty flavor in Houston. I split a Chicken Noodle Soup and Seafood Pancake with my mom and we were very impressed. The pancake is by far the best we have had in all of Houston. The authenticity cannot be beat! The seafood flavor with the crunchy texture is a fantastic combination. The seafood stands out and the sauce compliments the entire dish. The soup was amazing!! The ratio of meat, noodle, soup and vegetables were perfect! The pancake, however, was my favorite. The Chicken Noodle Soup comes in second, because I believe you can get the same tastiness in other parts of Houston. However, other diners were raving about the seafood noodle soup right beside us! Don't miss out on this place! The pancakes and the soups are fantastic!! The prices are decent and definitely worth it. Make a trip soon!!
