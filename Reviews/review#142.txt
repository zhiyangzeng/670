Went to Korean noodle house for the first time, it's a very interesting place ! It's in an old house in a Korean neighborhood, easy to find.Inside its got a homey bright atmosphere and a young vibe. Most customers were young Chinese Â and the menu is Korean w Chinese influences (dumplings, soups, etc). The kimchi is strong (which I like) but too oniony for me. In fact your clothes will smell like onions when u get home !Tried the bulgogi fried rice, very nice, and the bulgogi noodles, very healthy and tasty. The food is fresh and yum.Service was slow but the prices are reasonable. Recommend if u r in the neighborhood! Oh, u can get 10 free dumplings on ur 8th visit lol :)
