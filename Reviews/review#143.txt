My feelings on this place are like a text message to your significant other when he/she asks why you are ending it: just not into it.Octopus and mushroom "stew"- soup base served with rice. There is NOT ENOUGH food in a serving to justify $10. While the flavor was very enjoyable, I don't pay $10-11 and lean on rice to take care of having enough to eat, and I am a medium eater. If you are a big eater, you are just fcked. Better ask for a second bowl of rice, Bubba.Spicy seafood soup- Popular for their noodles, which is what they are counting on to keep you full for the next hour as there's not much else in there. There's one medium-sized shrimp, one scallop the size of a quarter, and a few mussels with meat the size of a dime. I would easily be appeased if banchan was served here, but yes- I know it is a noodle house so they don't. Even if it is a noodle house, I shouldn't pay $10-12 per entree and feel like all I'm really eating are noodles and rice. Though this place gives you kimchee as a starter, I can't eat kimchee until I'm full.Business is booming, and they definitely can make it without me.
