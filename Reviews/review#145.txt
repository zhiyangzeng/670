I still enjoy this place very much but tonight's experience was inconsistent from my previous. Â My family and I dined here tonight around 6:50pm. I wasn't sure if they ran out of ingredients or something but they skimped out on the seafood in my jjamppong and my husband's beef &amp; octopus. I always order tge same thing, but it was lacking tonight. I am curious though... I thought the hot stone pot would have the crispy rice at the bottom, but it definitely didn't have any of that.
