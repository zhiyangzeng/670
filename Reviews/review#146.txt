Great little place and not on anyone's radar unless you know about it. We only found this yummy place because kind Yelpers posted about it. The drill: Pull in, ignore the fact that the restaurant is in a house and hidden by two other business. Persist in looking for the entrance. Go past the incredibly worn wooden porch and enter.Expect a family style environment. Here I faced a first time EVER. We are sat. After quite a few minutes, a waiter briskly comes by and announces he can't take order for 20 minutes because of take out.So we waited. Kudos for the large take out order and was rewarded by a stunningly good meal.I'll be back. Maybe this time, I'll just do take out ;)
