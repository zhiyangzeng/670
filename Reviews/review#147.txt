I love hidden gems! This place is one of them! Most dishes are about $10. Seafood pancake-good! Spicy seafood noodle soup-only one shrimp, has a shrimpy flavor, mussels included, and one scallop. Not bad! Big portion, lots of noodles! Kim chi fried rice-absolutely AMAZING! Comes with fried egg on top and little pieces of ham in it. Noodle with dumpling-it's like noodles on a day your sick, very light, bland, lots of noodles. COMPLIMENTARY DELICIOUS SPICY KIM CHI! Make sure you have some time, the service here isn't super great someone will come around and fill your drinks eventually. The restrooms are one person only, summer time can get hot in there. Â After you eat, make sure you pay on the way out! Outdoor seating is also available, they take card too! Tip: When you're ready to order, just close your menu so they know! Let me know how it goes yelpers!
