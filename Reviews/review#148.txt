The portion sizes of Korean noodle house has decreased significantly. I wonder if it's because this once hidden gem is no longer a hidden gem and in order for the staff to accommodate the crowds, they need to crank the food out quicker thus it seems the quality of their service and food suffers. It used to be my top favorite Korean noodle restaurant but on my recent visit, the seafood pancake lacks a lot of seafood that it used to have and the thickness of the batter is now very thin. The kimchi also didn't seem very fresh and the beef noodle soup's portion size has gotten smaller and the beef they serve is really dinky. In addition the chicken in the chicken noodle soup is small and not very fulfilling for my protein needs. It breaks my heart to give this restaurant 3 stars but they're just not the same as it used to be.
