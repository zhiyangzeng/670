My very first time trying kimchi and Korean food also. Saw a lot of mentions of the sea food pancake so we ordered that. YES ITS AMAZING. My brother got beef dumpling soup. I can't describe the noodles...they were dense and soft and I've never had anything like it! I ordered kimchi friend rice which was a little too much for me. I think it would have been better as a small side dish for me because it was so spicy. With winter right around the corner I will definitely be back for noodle soup!!!!
