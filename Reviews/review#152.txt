Such warmth. Much cozy. Very yum. Korean Noodle House is quite literally in a house, and the friendly owner and homemade food definitely impressed me. Because everything is homemade the flavors aren't too salty like in chain restaurants and everything is balanced, making for happy tummies. Portions are huge.FOODTax included in the menu prices! KNH has the spiciest kimchi I've ever had, given in unlimited servings and served in cute coffee mugs. For appetizer we got the fried dumplings as well as their seafood pancake. The dumplings were served with a small side of pickled radish for some acidic component, and the meat to skin ratio was good. Solid average app. The seafood pancake was tasty, although a bit flour-y... I don't know if it was because we were late customers but asides from that the flavor was light and the pancake was thick.For entree I opted for their beef dumpling noodle soup, expecting lightness. That was exactly what I got! It was really gentle flavoring and perfect for sick people. Don't get me wrong -- it was like a warm bowl of chicken noodle but better. They used the same dumplings as the app, so I got to try them in two different dishes. Pieces of beef and cabbage also floated around in the broth.AMBIENCE/SERVICEAfter taking a few bites of kimchi one of my tablemates legitimately started sweating. I think he drank four cups of water during that meal. The server constantly refilled water and bossman himself came by to take our order, asking if we were okay with a teasing tone. The entire feeling of this place is pleasant.Come eat and be sated with the warmth and homemade love of Korean Noodle House.
