I tried this place for the very first time the other day with my sister in law and I can say I was not impressed at all. To start out the service was extremely slow to get which is shocking considering that all the staff was in the from eating and there was only 1 other table in the entire place. I ordered a number 11 I believe which is a noodle dish served with rice and beef, or so they say. When I got the food there was tons of noodles which is great.. But beef? There was barely any and in fact there was such a small portion I wondered why they even even described it to have beef. Very disappointing. Now I am a fair person so I'll give this place 2 stars because the food was hot, fresh, and good. But the entree itself was misleading based on how it was described in the menu and the service was not great. I can say with certainty that I will not be coming back based on the fact I know several different places at the same price with better food but if you do try this place best of luck too you.
