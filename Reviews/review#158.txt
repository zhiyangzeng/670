Very cute &amp; quaintly decorated Korean restaurant. I love this place especially because I love supporting local businesses.Great authentic Korean noodle dishes, only downside is that their only banchan is kimchi. But regardless their kimchi is wonderfully delicious. Hot noodle soup &amp; cold noodles so they have dishes for any season or mood. I think it's absolutely enamoring that the restaurant is an actual house, which gives a quirky old homey feeling as you eat your noodles. One of my favorite noodle places to go, great naeng myun for when it's Summer!
