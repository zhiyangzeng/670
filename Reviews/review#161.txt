This place is tucked away in a neighborhood adjacent to a church and the various shopping strips along Long Point. It's easy to pass along unless you hear recommendations from a friend (or Yelp). I'm a big fan of their complimentary Kim chi: just enough kick for flavor and not too much to scare off the meek. Their service is pretty friendly and for a mom and pop shop, it's pretty clean, if not a bit low key. I ordered the bulgogi, spicy Seafood soup, and spicy octopus soup on separate occasions; each was flavorful, and the spicy dishes were hot enough to make my nose run. Beware - the portions are absolutely huge, even if it's mostly soup base. Don't expect to walk away hungry. At the end, they have me a punch card for rewards in later visits. I doubt I'll be back 9 more times, but they haven't given me a reason not to return.
