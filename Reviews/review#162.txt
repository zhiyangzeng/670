Nice people and nice food. We stopped by before checking out the new Hong Kong market next door, and enticed by the idea of pho, popped in to check it out. The waiters are extremely courteous and nice. One kept calling me "miss," and I felt so, so old =.= haha~ but he answered questions about the menu enthusiastically and check in on us while we ate (and not too often ^^b).Although called Noodles, Inc., this place serves rice dishes along with the rice noodle soups and steamed vermicelli dishes too!  The egg roll and chicken wings appetizers are fried lightly, instead of having the thick layer of batter and oily skin that other places usually have... Really cool @-@  as for the entrees, I'm not an Vietnamese cuisine expert, but the pho was all right. Good, satisfying, but nothing like BAM, party-in-your-mouth brain explosion :P I got the combo pho, and the broth was really light, not the super savory type I like, but probably a lot healthier! That's probably why the beef didn't have that much flavor, but it was satisfying. (Everything tastes good with hoisin and Siracha, right? ;D). My dad got the chargrilled pork rice, which looked really good (uploaded a few pictures ^^!), and he said was quite tasty. If I come back, I'll be ordering a rice dish :)Although I won't be singing praises about this place on the streets broadway-style (yes, I've done that :3), Noodles, Inc. is clean, spacious, and has a nice team of servers ready to deliver some good Vietnamese food to your table. If you're in the area and hungry, this is a nice place to stop by. (^o^)
