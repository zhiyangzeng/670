Mediocre food amongst a sea of Vietnamese restaurants. Had the pho and bun thit nuong.  Pho broth was a bit bland and had to add extra fish sauce and housin sauce to compensate.  Bun thit nuong was ok but lacked the BBQ pork lemongrass marinade to give it that special taste.The positives include the service, cleanliness and convenience to Hobby airport.
