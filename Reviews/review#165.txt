Pho fanatic let me tell ya. I eat it any meal of the day and noodle inc fits the bill when you are attempting to get your appetite quenched. I ordered two orders of the number 8 and was very pleased with the amount of ingredients in the pho. It's the Big Mac of pho, it come with tripe, tendon, brisket and a few more meats. Only problem I had was the fresh fixing they give you to insert into your bowl. The jalape√±o had a moldy like substance and really ticked me off because it rubbed aganist the cilantro and other fresh ingredients. No tip today noodles inc. good pho for the most part.... Oh yeah they need to get a water softener or something all those water spots on the glasses are pleasing. White bob just keeping it real... Signing out
