Let me start off this review by saying three words:AWESOMEAMAZINGYUMMY1. Awesome: The restaurant is located in a unique strip mall on gulf fwy. It has a cool vibe when you walk in with high ceilings and cherry blossoms along the walls! They offer large plates, so two to three people may eat off of one and be full. In this day and age with our economy, this is uber important! 2. Amazing: I met the ambitious, courteous, and extremely humble owner of the restaurant. There are many pho restaurants in Houston, which makes the market very competitive, however, his attention to detail in his dishes, and amazing customer service will keep me coming back. 3. Yummy: Long story short ... This is the best Pho I've ever had!!!!!!!!!! The grilled pork was perfectly cooked with flavorful char marks. I also got the marinated chicken breast which was spicy and tender. As well as the cubed beef for added touch. The fried rice knocked my sox off. Thank goodness for left overs, cuz I can't wait to eat them!!!!!!!! All in all, if you want crazy good food ... GO HERE!
