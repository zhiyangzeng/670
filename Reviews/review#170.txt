Love it here. The staff is always friendly and eager to help you out. Van, the owner is there more times than not to greet you. I usually get the #19 spicy, but today I was in the mood for beef and he went to the back and whipped up something not on the menu. The fact that he did that was pretty cool all on its own, it tasted great.
