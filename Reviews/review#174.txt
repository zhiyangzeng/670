Was not greeted at all at the front. Service was not warming. The food was ok, tofu was really dry. The girl at the front kept my card on accident and when I came back and asked her if she had it she said she was sure she didn't, guess who had it all along? Not me. This got two starts because the Thai tea was really good other than avoid this place.
