Wonderful place! I was looking for a Vietnamese restaurant by my office and this one had good reviews so I thought I'd try it. I ordered the pork over rice with vegetables with a side of egg rolls. The pork was excellent and the vegetables were fresh! Staff was polite and welcoming. They speak English just fine as I know that is a concern going to certain places. Ordered a Vietnamese coffee to go and it was perfect! Just the pick me up after a meal like that. Would definitely come back!
