I was so impressed with the service, the price, the quality and quantity of food that I am just dancing a little jig right now. I ordered the noodle soup with chicken breast and an order of spring rolls with peanut sauce to go. I paid for it and told the man who took my order that I was going to step next door to get some green tea and I would be right back. Well, while I was waiting for my green tea he shows up with my package of food! How nice is that? Really made me feel special. Then I got home and put the soup all together. It was delicious to the very last bite.
