Ok my honey and I have been frequenting this place weekly... Apparently we have a table! The pho is good here... My boyfriend loves the fact that they put the meat on the side and not in the pho! I've also had the bo luc lac which was really good... Cooked perfectly medium rare...The guy who works here (most likely the owner) is awesome... He's nice and works hard. The place is really clean and neat... Modern style and my boyfriend loves the music! You gotta stop by!
