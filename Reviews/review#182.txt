I heart ph.....! I'm gonna keep this simple:Owner: grand! Ph is best on southeast I've had.  Order the #22.  It's not on the menu but it's so good and ask for Van to describe it,  it will make your mouth water.  So quit reading this review and go eat!!!  Afterward go to the Hong Kong mall and buy some jack fruit and go home and have that for dessert.  Just YouTube how to cut.  yum yum!
