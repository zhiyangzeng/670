My traveling companion picked this place based on reviews posted on line and what an incredible pick he made.  First, the atmosphere is modern, open and bright, atypical of many of the Asian food restaurants I've previously frequented.  Van, the owner/chef, was incredibly friendly and his descriptions of the ingredients and preparations of dishes infused us with his own obvious joy for his creations.As many of the other reviews have stated, you have to try "Number 22" on the 21 item menu.  This dish of rice noodles, glazed semisweet pork, fresh vegetables and spicy sauce was incredible.  Honestly, it was without a doubt the best Asian - not just Vietnamese - dish I have eaten.If time allows, following work tomorrow we plan on returning to this wonderful treasure to try item "Number 23" or maybe "Number 24".
