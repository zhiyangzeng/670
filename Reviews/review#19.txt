We went on a Friday night around 6pm. The parking lot was very small but we managed to find a spot. The stores next to the restaurant had bars up meaning this neighborhood was shady. We entered and was greeted and seated right away. The decor and ambience inside was really nice compared to the outside. We got the char-grilled pork wrapped in rice paper as appetizer. It came out fairly quick but it was so small and thin. It came with a bland peanut sauce too. It was basically rice paper, lettuce, and very little char-grilled pork. The pork had flavor and was very good but there were barely any in there. This dish was basically a little snack. Next dish was the com bo luc lac with fried egg for $16! That is extremely pricey for the amount we got. Again, it was stingy on the protein and a bunch of red, green pepper and onions. It was really tasty but was not enough. Not worth the price at all! Last, we got banh cuon with pork for $8.50. It was also very tasty but as you can see from the theme here, not enough. It looked like a lot but that's because there are lettuce and cucumbers at the bottom and the thin rice papered pork was on top. I would consider this appetizer. Overall, very disappointing. Expensive and not filling though it was tasty, I'm pretty sure I can find another place that serve these dishes at a larger portion.
