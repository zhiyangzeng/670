First time trying the pho and I am so impressed! Everything from the initial phone call (I got it to go) to when I finished it was great!! The flavor is so delicious! I love that they packed everything separate. I ordered the combination but in the future I will probably get the beef flank with tripe. So delicious! The girl who took my order was very knowledgeable of the menu. Will definitely go back!
