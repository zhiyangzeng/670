Love this place!! I used to have a hard time convincing my boyfriend to try any pho place since we tried the one across the street from this place. But this place is so good we've been coming every week!      The #5 is delicious and it has the right amount of noodle to broth. Some pho places lack flavor or put too much soup but this place has the best pho noodles and the right amount of meat. The egg rolls are amazing too and you'll never order without it.     You can definitely tell how popular this place is since every table around you seems to be filled with regular customers that the owner knows. It's amazing that the owner can handle serving an entire restaurant on his own while taking Togo orders and running food. I have never seen anybody leave here without looking very satisfied. You can tell the owner truly loves his line of work and makes it his goal to deliver excellent service to every table! Definitely give props to him for being skilled!      Definitely try this place out if you're in search of some good pho, or authentic Asian food in the area in general. You'll never leave disappointed!
