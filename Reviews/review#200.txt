Super friendly. Clean. Lots of good natural lighting. Run by two brothers that were formerly in the Sushi business. Said they are bringing the sushi standards of food freshness and quality alongside American style of hospitality to the Vietnamese food arena. Had the bahn mi which was excellently balanced between bread and toppings. Bread is specially made for them too. Not as stone hard and roof of mouth cutting as other pho places. Very nice. Pho was excellent as well. It is a Must Do lunch stop!
