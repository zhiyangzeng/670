additional parking in an upstairs lot above the complex. happily i noticed they had eggrolls sold individually and affordably too. the eggroll wasn't bad, and i can never have more than one without feeling disgusting so i got one as an appetizer. ordered the beef noodle stew with tomato base beef broth (bo kho??? did i spell that right???) and it was nice and hearty. i prefer the thick noodle over the thin noodle that they have here, but the flavor was still all there, and it was definitely delicious on a cold day.will try their actual pho next time, heheh
