Classic pho option - Pho Saigon is my go-to.Order the large; it's way bigger than the small, and it's only $1 more. The ~special~ pho is 50 cents more from the large and includes pretty much every part of the cow in it, but I personally prefer less things in my pho.Amazingly for a Midtown spot, parking here is not stressful at all - there's a dedicated lot for the plaza Pho Saigon is in! There's almost always a spot open, and the worst thing I can think of is that you might have to park in the far corner of the lot, which is like...an extra 50 feet away.Super convenient place to get your pho fix!
