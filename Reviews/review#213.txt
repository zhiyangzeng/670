It's my go to without having to get raped by Mai's marked up midtown prices. Don't get me wrong, Mai's is great, but for the price the phō and soups are awesome. The service is quick and the staff is very tentative. So if you stay midtown/downtown/med center/near town and you're trying to avoid Belliare/ Chinatown area (door dings, &amp; bad traffic), then give phō Saigon a try, you won't be let down.
