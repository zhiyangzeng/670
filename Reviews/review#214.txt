Food was ok there. was a hundred different plates to choose from but when you look at the ingredients on the menu it's only because it's been modified by one item. service is a little strange while I was eating they kept trying to take away sauces from my table as if I was finished then they didn't give the person I came with silverware and on top of it they set an entire napkin container in front of him. We weren't sure what to do with that.
