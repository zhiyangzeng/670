The broth used for the Pho is pretty good here, and I've also had their vermicelli noodles with the Vietnamese egg rolls and bbq pork.  It's inexpensive and the food is pretty good.  Parking will be tough during lunch hours, but you can always park on the 2nd floor.  It also gets really busy during lunch time, so try to go early.  There is enough space to accomodate larger parties if you get there early enough.
