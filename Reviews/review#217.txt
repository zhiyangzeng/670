I've been coming here since I was a teenager and the Pho is always consistent and comes out in no time. I like that you can order a small or large bowl to satisfy whatever type of appetite you may have. I usually order the pho dac biet or pho tai nam. I wish they left the chilli oil at the table, I had to walk over and ask because I couldn't get anyone's attention. I haven't had their rice plates here but they look good.
