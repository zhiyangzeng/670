I predominantly live in DC and am used to absolutely phenomenal pho... That being said...I have no idea what the hype over this place is for. I was so pumped to try this place considering its reviews but tbh - the pho was very bland. Like... It mainly tasted like water. Ok it's cheap (three bucks cheaper than the avg DC pho) and the service is quick, but the servers are, for the most part, inattentive and short with you. I asked for eye of round and the lean meat and got flank with eye of round. Fortunately, one of the waitresses was super sweet and brought a side of the lean meat (one extra star for the gesture) but we also had to obnoxiously wave to get their attention because nobody walked by to discuss the mistake to within 6 minutes. I know, I've worked in food service through school- even I'm embarrassed we had to wave but apparently staring across the room doesn't do a thing.If this is the best pho in Houston... I guess I'll stick to other cuisines while at home.
