Pho Saigon seems to be the go to pho restaurant in the area, and as a lover of all things pho related, I had to give it a try. While parking was a pain, the interior was pretty clean and spacious. Additionally, we were served right away.In terms of flavor, however, I was a bit disappointed. While the meat of the pho tai had a good texture, it wasn't really special and didn't have much flavor. The broth was well seasoned, but again it was only average. The thing I did enjoy though was their egg rolls. They were nice, crispy, and tasty, but I wished there was more filling.
