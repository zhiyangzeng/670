I've been here a few times for late dinner (after midtown shenanigans lol) The service has always been quick and the food is fresh and yummy. The staff is always nice and know how to handle loud drunk people very well. lol The back parking lot although spacious seems a bit sketchy but the restaurant itself is decent. As for their menu, they have several options to choose from; I was quite overwhelmed, to be honest. I usually opt for an order of chicken spring rolls for a lighter dinner but I'll have their General Tso Chicken when I'm being fat. The spring rolls are pretty good but not the best I've had. The General Tso chicken is delicious with a nice spicy kick; It comes with your choice of steamed or fried rice, but I don't care for either or.
