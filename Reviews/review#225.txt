When I don't want to drive to Chinatown and don't want to spend too much time out, this is one of our go to places.  Last night, being on the chillier side, we wanted pho and as always the place was popping.  However, this place is quite speedy, once you walk in, you are greeted, seated, and then your order is taken, lol this all occurs in ~5 minutes so be sure to look at the menu ahead of time.  Last night, I wasn't quite as prepared and so I missed the ordering part and had to wait a bit before the waitress came to take our order.By the way, some of the waiters/waitress don't speak English so it is best to point to what you want on the menu.  I asked if I could modify one of the beef noodle soups as I just wanted tripe, tendon, and eye round steak and I was just met with a blank stare so I ended up ordering #9 Special Combination.  The broth is consistently solid, but nothing spectacular, and they gave a good amount of meat (eye round steak, well done flank, fatty brisket), but the ratio of fat to meat could have been better, also they only give you one small meatball, a few pieces of tripe, and I got one piece of tendon...Luckily, my bf got more, so I guess the distribution is a bit uneven.If you aren't in the mood for soup, I actually prefer their Vermicelli bowls which comes with beansprouts, mint, carrots, lettuce, cucumbers, green onions, cilantro, peanuts and your choice of protein.  I prefer #65 vermicelli with charbroiled sliced pork which is always super flavorful and bonus, you get a deliciously fried egg roll and yummy fish sauce on the side!Overall, this is an A-OK place for a solid, consistent, quick, more affordable meal (it seems as if prices increase each year or two, now a small bowl of soup is $5.75, large is $6.75, and Special Combination is $7.25).
