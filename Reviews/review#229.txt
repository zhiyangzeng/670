The tofu bun (vermicelli tofu with vegetables) is really good, with the addition of their peanut and hoisin sauce (upon request). Their soybean drink is a great drink (it's a pretty green color) and tastes amazing. Their thai iced tea with tapioca pearls is super good as well and overall refreshing to drink!Hot tea is not complimentary, you have to pay for it.The tofu pho is not vegetarian, since they use chicken broth, so be aware!The bathroom is really clean!
