I personally enjoy going to this restaurant.  It's one of my favorites in Houston.  It's a fairly large restaurant with lots of sitting room.  During lunch time rush hour this place gets packed.  But service is still quick, friendly and food is priced affordably. My kind of restaurant!I love the seafood pho with egg noodles and spring rolls!! Delicious!!! They have a large menu but I always stick to my personal favorites.  During the lunch hour parking could be difficult to find, but there is a second floor parking area on the rooftop.
