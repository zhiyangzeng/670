Was between this place and a more reviewed  Vietnamese place on yelp. Decided on this one because from the pictures it looked a little more authentic. It did not disappoint!I ordered 2 spring rolls. I really don't like spring rolls that much, but since I'm Vietnamese I feel compelled to order them whenever I try a new Viet place. They were ok but the  Pho Dac Biet was very good!
