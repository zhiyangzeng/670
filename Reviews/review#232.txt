I had the mi ga (chicken with egg noodles), while everyone else had pho. We also had spring rolls. Everything tasted good. Nothing spectacular, but it's definitely a decent place worth going to get some MSG'd up soup noodles when you're hungover.If you ask for "onions," they give you a shit ton of green onions, which is awesome, but you need to specify.
