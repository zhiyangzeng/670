Probably the best Pho I have ever eaten.  Super Legit.  The juke box scratched when we walked in.  It was awesome.Tendon and Round Eye swimming in bone broth of noodles and lime squuuueeeeezed like you wanted to toss your body on the floor because you won the lottery.  Oh Jeez help me Lawd!   I got the small bowl.  The people next to me got the large bowl.  I think you could have parked a smart car in the bowl.  The Vietnamese Coffee is served traditional, not premade mixed before you get it to the table.  Legit.  I am only a little on the condensed side.  I do not need that much sugar in my life, sweet enough.  Rollllllllllllllllll me into a siracha spring roll yes maaaaaaaaaaaaaam.  Nom Nom Nom. Get on it.  The fun in the bun, hahah play on words and yes i know it does not rhyme, delish.  My escort for the evening got a chicken and rice....wait no idea, he ate it so fast I really could not tell you what it was.  So clearly, the plate could have been reused, must have been that much on the side of badassery.  Service is hilarious.  My brown friends needed forks, so she brought one.  Then brought a spoon haha.  We asked for coffee, got tea.  No worries we got it sorted out.  Language barrier.  Yep....makes you want to go more right?  Exactly.  It is hidden in the strip center, sign looked like it was off, windows are blacked out.  Seriously I would skip work and catch a flight back tomorrow and an uber.  So much happiness.
