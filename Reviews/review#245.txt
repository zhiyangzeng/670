Excellent spot! Yes, it's in an "unfavorable neighborhood" but it's well worth the trip. I went today for lunch. Super fast service. Staff was very friendly. The owner, Rudy, even came to speak to me while I was waiting on my order. The food was amazing! I got the Crab Angel, which I finished in the car half way back to work, and the Pineapple Curry with Chicken. I am a yellow curry kind of girl, but this dish has definitely got me on team Red Curry now. It has the right amount of spice with the added sweetness from the pineapple.... Yum. I will definitely be back. Note: There is another Nara's in the same parking lot. I accidentally went there first. But they have more Thai fast food, like sandwiches etc. Same owner. I will have to try them soon.
