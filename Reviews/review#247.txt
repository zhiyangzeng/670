So I was looking for great Thai food in my area and I saw the insane yelp reviews on this place and decided to give it a try. The reviews weren't lying when they said "diamond in the rough" and "ghetto". I had one of my chick friends go pick up for me and she called me pretty scared. Once you get over the fear of possibly being stabbed and go in to get the food you'll be met by a cute Asian man that will hook you up with the most glorious Thai food you've ever had. I had the pad kee mow ( drunken noodles) extra spicy. Wasn't really that spicy but sooo delicious. Also tries the panang curry spicy, again more sweet than spicy. Still very delicious. Only had carrots, but plenty of chicken so I'm not going to complain.This is officially my new take out place. Give it a try.
