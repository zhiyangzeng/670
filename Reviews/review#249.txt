Get over your fear of downtown.  This place is definitely a diamond in the rough, but after you creep yourself out driving up, walk through the lot without incident and get inside you'll forget about all that.Everything thing I've tried here was delicious, and they offer some dishes the other thai spots in the area either avoid altogether or mess up.  Don't know what you want? Great, they always have suggestions and when they ask about spice, they do blaze it up with chili if you ask.
