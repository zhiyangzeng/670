(Shudders) scary, bad part of midtown near the bus station. I literally saw a couple of police officers search a guy right out front. I think they were looking for drugs or something. There are two Nara Restaurants in this ghetto gas station. Both are by the same owner but have different menus and it's confusing as hell. I got the Pad Thai, which was one of the worse I've ever had. Soggy and sweet bleh!
