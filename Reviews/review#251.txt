Nara Thai Dinning Express is a small fast food style restaurant located next to a gas station. I thought I was going to get shot there but at least the food was worth it. (JK, it's not bad at all.) I am very picky about Thai food. It needs to be spicy when it suppose to be; it should not be greasy; it should has it's own original flavor - I know there are lots of so called good Thai restaurant out there serve Chinese stir fry knock off. Nara Thai's food met all my requirements and never disappointed me. You get to choose your own style of source, flavors and proteins. They are very flexible and can accommodate almost any of your customization request. Their special catfish curry and papaya salad are the must try, it is very flavorful, fulfilling and tasty. I also tried their Tom Yum soup, Pad Kar Pow, Veggie Delight, Thai Cashew Nut, Pad Thai, Yellow Curry, and I like all of them. Their price range from $5 - $15. Restaurant itself is simple and clean, it is half self-service style. Casher is very helpful and waitress always help to refill the drink quickly. My only wish is they can add brown rice option. I'll definitely come back.
