Phenomenal Thai food! If you love Thai food, this is the place to go! This is the best Thai food I have had outside of Thailand itself. It's reasonably priced - two orders of food and two drinks were $22 total. The neighborhood is sketchy but it's worth it. More to choose from here than it's sister restaurant on the other side, Nara Noodles. They have Thai tea too. Get the Pad Kee Mao!!!! Can't wait to go back!
