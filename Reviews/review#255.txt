I still can't believe that I found tasty Thai food at a place attached to an overpriced gas station in downtown Houston. I pass this area between work and school daily and always wish that I could find a place that served food to-go besides the Chipotle around the corner. I decided to give this place a try and I definitely wasn't disappointed. I love Thai food, and the flavors here are on point. Is it the best I've ever had? No. But this place gets bonus points for its location, friendly staff, and affordable prices. Their curries are great and my favorite noodle dish is the Pad Kee Mao. They've also done a great job with my small requests to add/take out ingredients in certain dishes. Parking can be a little sketch.. Also, there is a different restaurants on the other side of the Texaco so don't get confused. This place is on the right hand side if your facing the front of the gas station.
