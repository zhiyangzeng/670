Really 3 1/2 stars.It's connected to a gas station. That kind of weirded us out but we were pleasantly surprised. It's clean and open. You order at the counter. Lots of menu choices.I'm currently meatless so I had the fried spring rolls and the tofu lad see ew (N4) - flat noodles, egg and broccoli and a Thai ice tea. Oh and you can tell them the degree of spicy. The food came out very quickly. And it was good. I wish there was a little more noodle in my dish but it was tasty and full of tofu and broccoli. I wanted to try the dessert but we were toooooo full. We will def go back. They offer a papaya salad and I want to try it. There is also the standard Thai offerings - curry, pad Thai, soups etc.The staff was very courteous and nice. The prices are decent too.
