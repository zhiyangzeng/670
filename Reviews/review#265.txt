Couldn't agree more with most of the reviews for this place. This restaurant is definitely a diamond in the rough! Food is excellent, customer service is on point, food was ready super quick, restaurant is very clean as if it was new. My boyfriend and I had the red curry, pad kee mao and the delicious Thai iced tea. All great menu options!
