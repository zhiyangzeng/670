Typical hole in the wall kind of place. Located in a gas station.... Yes I'm saying a gas station!!! I ordered the Thai fried rice with chicken teriyaki. Well food is good, price is good, service was quick, servers are nice... easy parking.. If you are in the area worth a stop for a quick meal. Nothing fancy but good is good.
