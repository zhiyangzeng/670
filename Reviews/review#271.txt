This place is literally a hole in the wall at a gas station, pretty much in a really not so obvious spot. This is their express location, which I am guessing means is a little smaller than their other locations. I ordered Pad Thai, mostly just because that's the main reason why I went there. However, according to other photos and reviews, a lot of other dishes looked really good as well. I ordered the food to go, since I went near their closing time. When I went home, I saw they packaged a small spicy sauce with the dish. I had my Pad Thai medium level spicy, which I'd say is just the right amount, because Pad Thai in general is not supposed to really be a spicy dish. The food quantity was just right, and the food was very good. I don't like it when restaurants over sweeten Pad Thai, but this one was just right. The price of this place is also lower than the usual prices of Thai places. Definitely visit one of their locations!
