A shady area but ultimately a hidden gem of Thai food. You'll have to pass the views and encounters of pan-handlers, but the place is pretty clean inside and the service is friendly and accurate. Crab Angels - fried perfectly with a creamy, cheesy and crabby filling. 4 to an orderThom Kha Soup - delicious, hot and spicy with plenty of chicken and shreds of carrot. Orange Chicken - not too much breaking and sauce wasn't too overwhelming Panang chicken - Perfectly spiced with creamy curry and generous portions of chicken Pad Thai Chicken - noodles were perfectly textured and bits of shredded scrambled eggs with lots of chicken - requested regular spicy but it was milder than anticipated. Delish!
