Good food, bad location.  If you can get past the sketchiness of the location, great food awaits you at a very good price!  My boyfriend and I tried it as our first meal on New Year's Day, and I can tell you it was a great way to start off the new year.  He got the Massamum Curry with Beef and the fake Duck Meat sub on Pad Thai. I got the Green curry with the Duck Meat sub and a Pad Kee Mao with Beef. Both ordered spicy.  Be careful when you order spicy!  It's a challenging level of spice for anyone!  I was sucking a lot of air, and gulping down my drink quite a few times!  We we stuffed and satisfied....and the leftovers were very very good the next day.   Tips:  They own the Nara Noodle Grill on the other side of the gas station.  Smaller menu, but quality items.  Definitely more pan-asian cuisine.  Be aware.   Lots of homeless come in and beg for food and money.
