Delicious Thai food but in a seedy part of town. But since I go for groceries instead of ambience I loved it. The staff were very helpful and very personable. We only had one person walking in off the street and ask us for money. It is right across the street from the bus station. We had papaya salad, Thom Ka Gai soup. Massamum curry, curry chicken puff, Pad Kee Mow. All fantastic. We asked for medium heat. All flavors and heat were on point.
