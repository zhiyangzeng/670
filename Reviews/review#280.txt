This is definitely a hidden gem of Houston.  My wife and I LOVE our Thai food so when read/heard about this place we just had to try it.  I'll be honest, we were a little skeptical.  Although Houston does have a large Asian community that does not necessarily equate to decent Asian food.  This is especially the case with Thai food.Let's just say we were blown away by the quality, flavor, and overall taste of the food.  We went with some old favorites - Pad see eue (that's how they had it spelled on the board), Papaya salad (Som Tum), and Pad kra pow - that way we could compare it to other places.  The flavors were all on point.  The heat was on point.  We were able to order in the broken Thai that we know (Okay, my Thai is super broken but my wife, having spent part of her childhood in Thailand, speaks decent Thai.  But I only speak two languages English and bad English.  Is this too long for an aside?).I have only two complaints that are incredibly minor in the grand scheme of the universe:1) They need to have the vinegar with chili peppers.  That would be have taken the food from great to amazing.2) Any self respecting Thai restaurant, in my humble opinion, needs at least one picture of the King of Thailand.Keep up the great work and I'll definitely be back!
