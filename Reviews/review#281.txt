I have to tip my hat to Rudy, Roy and the crew here at Nara Thai. It's an incredible feat that they have so many people coming to one of the drabbest, shittiest street corners inside the loop. It's a testament to their commitment to quality, fresh food. Order any curry, rice, or appetizer dish, and you can tell it's prepared with integrity. It's prepared right there on the spot.My favs are the curry puffs, with their flaky crust and flavorful minced meat mixture inside; the tiger's tear salad, tender chopped steak pieces in a spicy, citrusy salad; and the pineapple fried rice.The folks that work here are warm hearted, good folks. You'll feel like this is your thai place. And it should be.
