Rudy, the manager, has a knack for doing things right when it comes to serving quality, fresh food at great prices.  This establishment started off as a good sandwich shop and they have added some very good Thai dishes to the menu.  With regard to their sandwiches, they don't skimp on the protein and give you lots of it.  They are very good sandwiches and there's not much more to say about a Vietnamese banh mi.  With regard to their Thai dishes, my favorite is the Khao Soi. It's a northern Thai noodle dish that is not often found in many Thai restaurants across the country and when it's done right, it's a great dish.  The most famous place to get it is at the Lotus of Siam in Vegas.  In my opinion, this dish is every bit as good, if not better.  I would highly recommend that you try it.  I also had the boiled chicken with the chicken rice.  It's a simple dish but it's also a dish that you can go very wrong, if the chicken is not moist or the rice is overcooked and dry.  I love their chicken rice here and the boiled chicken is moist and flavorful.  The dipping sauce for the chicken is fantastic. If you like teriyaki, you can also get those dishes here. I'm not a huge fan of teriyaki so it's not something I would order over the items described above.  All of the dishes are very reasonably price.  Nara is definitely on my weekly rotation.
