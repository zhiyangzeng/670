Easy and quick sitdown place for ramen. Their vegan broth whether regular or miso both taste better than Jinya but their noodles are not as good. Part of it may be because the broth is oily due to the stir fry vegetables used rather the raw ones that Jinya dump into their soup.Location is easy to get to although confusing for someone not familiar with the Durham/Shepherd parallel one-ways. Plenty of parking. Decor is minimalist but they should invest in something that sucks up the fumes. You will smell like ramen broth leaving the place. Despite the lower overhead than the Jinya in midtown, prices are higher here.
