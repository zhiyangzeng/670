I've always driven past this place but never really paid attention since it's in a pretty unassuming location. My bf &amp; I decided to try this place out on a whim one evening and I was pleasantly surprised. We started off with the Takoyaki appetizer, which I thought it was good and would order again. As for the ramen, we both ordered the Spicy Miso Tonkotsu. Our server suggested that we each try a tonkotsu ramen and shoyu ramen for variety. He even offered to let us order another ramen dish if we didn't like the shoyu ramen. I really appreciated the fact that they offer this! Alas, we didn't budge on our initial orders because it sounded so good and we would feel bad if they had to make another dish. The Spicy Miso Tonkotsu ramen turned out to be really good and broth was tasty! Also, add an egg to your order. The egg was cooked perfectly. Service was good and attentive. Bonus for taking the time to give us recommendations and making the aforementioned offer. I could tell he just really wanted us to get a well-rounded experience. I promise that I will try the shoyu ramen next time. I'm glad that we decided to try out this place because now I have another good restaurant to get my ramen fix. I'll be back. :)
