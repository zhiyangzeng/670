We ordered Mì Qung, Bánh Cun Tôm Chy, and Egg Rolls. Mì Qung is really good I have to admit everyone should try it. Bánh cun is cold. They admitted that they cooked it in room temperature on purpose (why?) We had to ask them to reheat it. Egg rolls tastes like Vietnamese Bánh xèo, so, it's OK if you want a new taste for egg roll. But the fish sauce to go with both Banh Cuon and Banh Xeo (which is very important in adding the flavor) doesn't taste good at all. We had a really hard time to get a server every time we need something. Actually staff are kind of careless. They didn't give us fork or chopsticks until we had to ask for them. There are around 6 staffs in the restaurant at the time, 3 tables (2 customers in each table) No one bothered to look at our table until we had to yell "Excuse me!". They didn't clean up the empty dish when then brought us our new food. I'm giving 2 stars: 1 for the Mi Quang, and 1 for Michael, the only man (I think he's one of the managers as well) who came to our table, ran around with other customers, AND smile. Tip for the restaurant: don't let ALL of your staff sit down for lunch in the table not too far from customers at the same time.
