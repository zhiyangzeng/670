Yum yum. I live just a few blocks away, so it's easy to get my ramen fix here. It's a pretty small shop but there's plenty of parking. Can get pretty crowded at times. I wouldn't expect it, but this place has the. Best. Gyoza!! Yummy and crispy and hot and has this layer of fried stuff on top. As far as ramens go, I typically don't like the tonkotsu (pork) broth and opt for the shoyu (chicken). I've had the spicy garlic, garlic, combination shoyu tonkotsu, and the mushroom. The garlic is good but your breath will smell for the next 2 days (so make sure your significant other doesn't get it...!!). My favorite is the mushroom. It's peppery and flavorful and not super heavy. Mmmmmmmm. You can get pork shoulder, pork belly, chicken, or tofu to accompany your ramen.PS: Add an egg, dammit!!
