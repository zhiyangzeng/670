I like thier ramen, and have been there several times. Unfortunately I found a bug in the bowel this time,  It look like a fruit fly, but a bit bigger, and I regretted that I did not take the photo.  Because when I told the waiter, the first word from him is "I don't know what it is, you tell me." And I said "looks like a bug to me, definitely not a sesame" and he said "where are the legs?" WTF!The other guy came over and offer to replace it or comp it. I said I dont think i want another one. As I stand up and walk away. The first guy said something like we all have eatten bugs. Well, maybe so, but I didnt plan to find that in a restaurant.
