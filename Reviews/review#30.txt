If you're in downtown and you don't feel like making the drive to bellaire for Vietnamese food, this is the place to go! However, prices are higher due to this reason too. The location itself is pretty sketchy outside and has very limited parking. Inside is nice and looks recently remodeled. Pan fried, seafood flat noodles: they cut the flat noodles in triangles after frying both sides.. I didn't like this. My friend did though. I prefer my noodles not crispy. Ratio of noodles to seafood was bad too. Felt like it needed more noodles, surprisingly. It is usually the other way around. You get squid, imitation crab, and shrimp. (3/5) Pho: nothing special but I also feel like pho is the same everywhere. Someone is probably shaking their head at me right now. (5/5)Combination bahn cuon: 6 rice rolls, 2 each of shrimp, ground pork and beef on a bed of been sprouts and cucumber. I was not a fan of the beef. I felt like they should have had ground beef instead of actually slices of it, but the other two were good. (4/5)Don't know the name but their sizzling beef platter with egg and a couple of Chinese sausage. I didn't taste this, but my friend said it was good. Would I come back? Only if I don't want to make my way to bellaire
