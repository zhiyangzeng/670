I'll keep this short and sweet. If you love yourself and like nice things GET THE SPICY TONKATSU w/ garlic. The broth was deep and flavorful, and the green onion?! Listen, shut up and listen again. I don't even like corn and I was lapping it out of the bowl like a common house cat. I ordered takeout and my food was ready as soon as I walked through the door. Easy to find, ample parking. Zero complaints here..... Oooh, almost forgot, if you you're thinking about the gyoza. There answer is yes. Treat yourself, don't cheat yourself.
