Oh samurai noodle, we almost skipped out on you heading to another ramen place nearby. We almost turned you away because of your low yelp reviews. You deserve so much more!!This ramen place has the best ramen broth we have tried in Houston!! The ramen is pretty cheap if you don't add on. However, it comes with less than most places so you end up adding on more and the price goes up. So that's the only sad thing. However, the ramen is well worth it! Compared to Tiger Den and Jinya, this place Â has the most flavorful broth! Yum yum, when can we go back?!
