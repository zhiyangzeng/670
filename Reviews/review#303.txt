I'll be honest, I wasn't that impressed. It might be what I ordered, the Spicy Chicken Ramen. The inside of the restaurant was ok, but just looking around it just seemed a little unclean. It's probably due to the high traffic, but even the condiments looked like they hadn't been cleaned in a while. I may try it again, try something more popular, but you know, with all the great restaurants out it's hard to give a place a second chance...but I will try.Tip, I suggest going with the soft noodles, ramen noodles al dente do not taste good.For more check out my blog!
