Ramen noodle always my all time favorite. This is by far the best ramen noodle in town that I have tried in Houston area.  Been going to Tiger Den since it opened and loved it, so decided to give this new place a try after I yelped it. To celebrate my birthday and CNY, my tow best friends took me here. Thomas the owner greet us immediately.  He was attentive and very accommodating.  He explains the different ramen noodle to us, so we can pick the ones that we want.  He even gave us three 'birthday drink glass shots, they are very refreshing and tasty.  I ordered spicy miso tongatsu, which is very delish.  And my friends ordered shoyu ramen with mushrooms and tongatsu ramen with egg. We all like it very much.Thomas said they even made their noodle fresh @ the store daily, and you can pick your noodle chewy, regular, or soft.  You can even buy their noodle to bring home to cook~Highly recommended for anyone who loves ramen noodle.  Even though this place is a little far away from where I live, I will be back.
