I wanted to like Samurai Noodle for a lot of reasons.  1. It's literally around the corner from my place.  2. I loooove me some ramen.3, I've been waiting to try this place fooooorrrreeevvvver.Unfortunately, this joint was a let down as soon as we stepped foot in the door.  We came on a Friday evening and the restaurant wasn't terribly busy.  It took us awhile to get seated, forever for someone to take our order, and an eternity for someone to ring us up.  Typically, if service is off it's not a big deal.  I understand..some places just have their off nights or they're understaffed or whatever the problem is.  Fine.   The food did not make up for the lack of service.  We started with the chicken karaage.  It was alright.  Not crispy enough for my liking but the flavor was there.  I had the spicy miso tonkotsu and it was basically a bowl of salt.  There was very little pork.  My boyfriend had the spicy tonkotsu which was even saltier than my bowl.  It was so spicy it took away from the flavor of the broth.  We both added eggs to our ramen (at an additional charge of course) and my boyfriend dug around and noticed he didn't have an egg.  He mentioned it to the waiter and the waiter asked us, "are you sure..?".  I don't know why this irritated me so much..I mean obviously we dug around..if we say there isn't an egg then there isn't an egg.  Anyway, I really wanted to like Samurai Noodle and I really hesitated to write this review but I felt it was necessary.  You've been warned.
