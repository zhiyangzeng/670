The moment you walk into this joint, you will feel like walking into a butcher shop with that unsettling porky smell! Located on Durham and I10, it can be tricky to get here due to the one way traffic on Durham unless if you know the neighborhood well.Now on to my beloved ramen... Similar to good bowl of pho, the broth can be either too heavy on herbs or protein (beef/meat). As for tonkotsu, I do prefer it to be rich, creamy and it didnt have that greasy after taste! As my first visit to any ramen place, I will order the basic tonkotsu and in my opinion, the broth here is way too greasy and heavy on the pork that was a little unappealing! As for the single slice of pork belly that was just being boiled not even braise, it was just inedible, chewy and only about 5% of lean meat and the rest was fat! In addition, you have to pay extra for the egg, dont waste your money on that... It was salty and badly marinated!So, if you are in midtown, the only option now is Jinya, which is quite good but I will rather drive to Tiger Den or Jin!
