Let me start off by saying that I was born and raised in Japan. I lived there for 16 years. My mom is Japanese. With that being said, this place is as authentic as it gets. I found it be accident looking through Yelp and boy am I glad that I did. I've been here three times and absolutely love it. The broth is flavorable and delicious!!! Noodles are made fresh daily with the perfect texture. My favorite is the shoyu ramen. Gyoza is good too.My boyfriend loves the spicy ramen. I personally think it's too spicy but that's because I'm not big on spicy food. If you like it spicy then this one is perfect for you.I heard that they're thinking about one in the woodlands. I can't wait for that location to open. Saves us 45 minutes of drive time :)
