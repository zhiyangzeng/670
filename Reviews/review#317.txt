Went here for a friend's birthday and she decided on the place. Thought it was a great idea at the time since I've never tried it before. It was a decent size and very spacious for the amount of tables they had. The seats were a bit uncomfortable.. just wooden chairs and benches. More of a family dining experience or extremely casual place to eat. Loved the concept that were able to see the kitchen from anywhere the customers would sit.We started off with 2 appetizers which I can't recall what they were.. I have pictures.. I tried cross reference on their site but it seems as though they're down! The gyozas were interesting because they were all still connected with a thin layer of.. I'm not sure what it was! lolll.. The taste was decent... but it was a bit oily and it seemed as though they didn't filter it or something. I had the Tampopo. The broth was a bit bland for my taste and so I added soy sauce to balance it out a bit for me.Overall the experience was decent, but not enough for me to go a second time. Authentic or not. The waiter was definitely friendly and he was extremely attentive. Thanks for the awesome experience! Have to admit though, the food was light but definitely filling. :)
