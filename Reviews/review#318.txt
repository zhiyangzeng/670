I wanted to try this place despite the fact that most items seemed to be an add on.  I tried the tonkotsu and added an egg and garlic.  I only received one piece of garlic and they did not carry the black garlic oil.  To make it spicier I had to order a red like spice bomb but it turns the ramen to an unappetizing red broth.  They claim they make their tonkotsu broth just like the original Hikari style in Japan.  While it had a nice creaminess it overall was lacking sufficient green onions and mushrooms.  I also would of liked either more garlic or garlic oil.  Overall it was bland.  My ramen had two pieces of chashu.  The first one was like a long piece of fatty flabby looking bacon.  The second piece was circular but was very fatty.  I make chashu at home and buy a leaner cut.  Plus their chashu was not charred on the edges so the fatty flabby chashu flavor was very pronounced and not in a good way.  One nice feature is Samurai offers their noodles in 5 different textures.  Mine were perfect.The waitstaff was pleasant.  I personally think the restaurant would have more appeal if they put up curtains or blocked all their mops, cleaning supplies and containers on the far right back wall.  Was not appealing at all to look at.  I was told their Shoyu ramen was their real stand out ramen.  I guess I'll give that one a try next time.  Hopefully I can bump them up in the star rating :)!Yelp Review #340
