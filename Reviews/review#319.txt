I finally made it here to have ramen in Houston for the first time in years. This was definitely better stuff than what I had a while back elsewhere. I came on a weeknight evening and it was fairly empty and the food came out fast.I went with my usual ramen order at most places: spicy miso tonkotsu + added green onions. I would've added mushrooms too, but they told me they're the shredded black kind...no thanks! It came with a nice amount of bean sprouts and corn, and a couple of slices of pork. The broth was not really spicy at all, which was a bit of a letdown, but it was creamy, flavorful, and filling. The noodles were a nice "medium" firmness, as they were advertised. I also had the gyoza and thought they were good. The filling is very flavorful, making them stand out a bit more from other places.The atmosphere is not the most inviting. It's a place I'd rather do take-out than eat in, since there's no chair backs to hang a purse, and it's so open and small. They're probably trying to make the most out of a tiny space, but it could be better. Fortunately, the ramen is tasty enough to entice me back.
