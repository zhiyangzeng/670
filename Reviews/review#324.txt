Yes, it's great to find good Chinese food in Innerloopistan!  I have to tell all my Innerloopers that the best Asian food is n Chinatown :-)  Still is!We met for dinner last week, we were a party of 3.  I didn't make reservations (who knew?), we arrived at 6 pm and were able to be seated.  But, within 30 mins of our arrival, there was a line out of the door.We ordered Dan Dan Noodles, Spicy Korean radish, sautéed green beans, seafood tofu.  Everything was delicisious, except the Dan dan noodles left a bit of a strange aftertaste. The radish was an appetizer and was super spicy but very tasty.  Green beans and seafood tofu were the best!  The tofu squares in the seafood tofu had been crisped up before being added to the seafood which gave it a nice texture and taste. I'll be back.
