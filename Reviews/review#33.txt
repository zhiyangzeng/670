I wanted to like this place but just thought it was Okay compared to other authentic vietnamese places in midtown.  I found the place very crowded and load.   The parking is hit or miss with a very crammed small lot. This seems to be a place where there are a lot of families with small children. The seafood pho was nothing to write home about and the service was kind of slow.
