Crowded on a rainy Friday night. The waiting area was small as people waited  a good 30-60 minutes for a spot. Comparable to Mala Sichuan as the best Chinese restaurant in the loop except the food feels more homecooked and the staff is extremely friendly. The food does taste better but I don't think it's vegetarian. There seems to be ample use of meat flavouring to cook the vegetables. The fried vegetables were cabbage that seemed like they were sauteed in a pork broth along with the chilis. The tomato omelet was delicious but my sister and I suspect there may be fish sauce in it.  Mapo tofu was the only dish I did not have any concerns about. So be sure to ask the wait staff about which dishes are truly vegetarian.My dining companions liked their beef tendon and chicken dishes but they were constantly scooping from my "vegetarian" dishes.
