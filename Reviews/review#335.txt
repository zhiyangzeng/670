Great and friendly service - and it was nice to see that Asian food can be authentic, tasty, and made with high-quality ingredients, especially inside the Loop. Usually Bellaire Chinatown is a must for anyone who wants something authentic and unique in Houston. But with the restaurant being Szechuan, it already won the unique category inside the Loop.But yes, they do have the regular, generic offerings for other people who lives in the area - on the back of the menu. It's the specialties on the front side of the menu that shines. And so I tasked our friendly waitress to pick some stuff that are great-tasting, not too spicy, and also authentic authentic! And not only did she excel in doing this, but she picked carefully to make sure that one dish complemented the other nicely. Match match were the key words.And so this came out to be our meal, which was fitting maybe for three people:+ vandaan noodles ($6)+ organic organic dumplings - so good they named it twice lol ($12)+ garlic-flavored cucumber ($9)+ super cubic (hot hot fried beef cube - $12)And really, we loved everything, and appreciated the fact that they were all made well. And thankfully made less spicy than what it could have been as they're accommodating to our tastes. The only thing is maybe the super cubic came out to be a little too spicy for me, but it was still tolerable, especially with the help of the other dishes - but what was impressive about this dish is that these are really small cubed beef. These small cubed beef elsewhere would normally come out too crispy and hard, or tough to chew - but the ones they serve here were so tender that it defied my expectations of just how good the little cubes of beef could be.Overall, this Schezuan place is a great find, and is made lovelier with the great service. Thank you!
