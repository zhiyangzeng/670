Ever since we've visited the first time,  cooking girl has become our favorite spot for date night,  introducing friends to the restaurant or even coworkers during lunch time.  In addition to my previous review here are others we recommend:-Twice cooked pork -pepper twins chicken: they import the peppercorns all the way from China! Remember not to eat them because it'll make your tongue all tingly. Drinking warm honey lemon tea seemed to soften the tingling.  Not water.  -honey lemon tea -  get it COLD. Trust me.  -general tso's chicken: I don't typically order Americanized Chinese food but one of our friends we took happened to order this.  Our first time it was sweet and we gave them feedback about it and they modified it.  Now it tastes so much better!-sweet &amp; sour shrimp - another Americanized dish that a friend ordered and this was good if you want to play it safe with seafood-spicy cubed beef: mini cut tender and flavorful beef For those who really want spicy,  you can request for them to make it spicier but you won't get to fully enjoy the taste.
