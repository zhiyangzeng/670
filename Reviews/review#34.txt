So... I can't remember the names of most of my dishes! Vietnamese is pretty hard to pronounce. I had the #5 appetizer, and the mi quang noodle dish. Both were pretty delicious and I'd do them again.A friend had the tofu curry, but I wasn't a huge fan. It was a little too sweet for me, I'm not a huge fan of sweet curries. The service was very friendly, polite, and quick for our group of 10. They split the check at the front efficiently, and I always appreciate when they don't make you feel bad for splitting. I'd go back if I was in the area :).
