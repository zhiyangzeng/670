YummmmMmmMmm. It's been a while since I've had Chinese food this good in a restaurant. It's totally homestyle and tastes like what my mom would make :'). The aunties here were also really friendly and made me feel at home here. I think some yelpers had questionable service, but my experience was perfect! We were seated immediately at 6:15 on a Tuesday, and after we ordered, the food came really quickly. The servers also came by often to fill up our water glasses. Now for the food:-Soy fried white lotus: just stir fried cabbage with some chilis but it was delicious! Really good, clean flavor and the cabbage was super fresh.-Spicy cubic beef: surprisingly tender pieces of meat with the classic Sichuan spicy. Yum!-Hot diving fish: super tender pieces of fish in a yummy sauce- I'm not sure what the sauce was exactly, but it was delicious. It wasn't super spicy so a good choice for people who can't take spice- compared to the water boiled fish.-Soft bacon: this is one of my favorite Chinese dishes and of course, they did it really well here. The pieces of pork belly were so soft and tender but not just all fat, which I prefer. And I love eating the preserved veggies with rice. -Dan Dan noodles: this was okay. I didn't like it as much as the other dishes. Not only this, but the quality of the steamed rice they use is also really good. The portions of the dishes were bigger than I expected, actually! They weren't huge but the quality makes up for it. I can tell that they put a lot of care and love into preparing their food, and I would love to come again :).
