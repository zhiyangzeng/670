My wife and I went there on Valentine's Day; we had reservations for 5:30; we arrived at 5:15, and were seated immediately. The service was friendly, informative and attentive.A little background: We (my Chinese-born wife and I) were overjoyed to learn that the well-regarded Mala Sichuan was opening a restaurant just 3 blocks from us in the Montrose. Therefore, we were ecstatic to learn that a second Sichuan-oriented estaurant was coming to the Montrose, But first we had to give it a test drive.To cut the chase, lovers of Inland, especially southwestern Flavors, will be pleased, Their food seems to be the real stuff, at reasonable prices ("reasonable" considering its proximity to Max's Wine Dive). We had the _mei cai kou rou_, referred to on the menu as "soft bacon, " the "Super Cubic", cubes of fried beef stir-fried with lots of red peppers, the "sweet yam salad, " (which is actually the "Chinese yam," not a sweet potato at all but a crunchy tuber usually eaten raw.)Everything was delicious, and my wife, always sceptical of Chinese restaurants inside the Loop, paid them her highest compliment: "I definitely will return."Parenthetically, I was able to confirm that all the senior staff do have graduate degrees, in Medicine, business, etc. They just love to cook!
