More of a 3.5 star. Jammed packed on Saturday at 7pm. Waited about 30 mins for a table without reservation. Its an organized mess at the hostess stand but they have it moving quickly. Byob: $4.99 for wine and $0.99 for beer corkage fee. We ordered the TMD soft bacon, super cubic (hot hot fried beef cube), twice cooked pork, hot sauce and boiled fish, mapo tofu, dry fried green beans, and saut√©ed lamb meat. Everything was good but I was missing that numbing sensation you get when you eat Sichuan food. Nothing was overly spicy so it's safe to eat. Some stand outs were the beef cubes, twice cooked pork, green beans, lamb, and tofu. I can do without the soft bacon and boiled fish if I come back. Worth the try. All employees were nice from the girl handling the hostess stand to the guy filling our waters.
