Cooking girl! I'm so glad to have you in town - another place I can get my authentic Asian fix without having to go out to Bellaire! I thought the wait would be long but I guess we beat the rush around 7ish on a Friday night! Cause by 8:30 there was a line out the door! The restaurant is in Montrose very close to baby Barnaby's and Boheme! Super cute little place with 15ish tables and very clean and bright! Omg the soft bacon/pork belly.  It melts in your mouth and it is so delicious! It is served with Asian pickled veggies but the flavors are amazing and the thinly sliced pork belly is cooked to perfection! The fried green beans were slightly overdone. I wish they were a bit crunchier. The Dan Dan noodles definitely had a spice to them with the chili oil on top. I wish there was a bit more meat on the dish - so I'd have to say I like the Dan Dan noodles at Mala Schezuan better.. As with the fried string beans.  The cold noodles had a different flavor and was good.  I don't think I preferred the noodle dishes here from everything we ordered.  The house dumplings were nice and crispy on the outside and juicy inside. They were delicious! Soft bacon and dumplings for the win!! Would definitely come back here for my Asian fix close to town! Definitely a good spot, friendly staff and very authentic!
