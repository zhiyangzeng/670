The hype is real, I am jumping on this "Cooking Girl" bandwagon. It has been a while since my husband and I enjoyed and became excited about a meal this much. As we were enjoying our meal, my main concern was "oh gosh, I hope I don't get full soon". We came for dinner on a Friday night around 7ish. We waited 15 mins for a table of two. Apparently the crowd came after 7:30PM because when we were walking out, we couldn't barely getting thru the crowd in the waiting area. The staffs were friendly and thoughtful. They were  treating us like we were guests at their house. Parking of course is not fun around this area. The husband dropped me off first before parking a couple blocks away. Now, on to the good part, FOOD. For the two of us, we ordered the fried green beans, the diving fish, and the peppercorns chicken. For drink, we ordered the Dr. Lee's tea. The food was AMAZING! The green beans weren't really fried at all. It was seasoned with garlic and ginger. It has a nice flavor to it. It wasn't salty at all. The diving fish was super fresh and the sauce it comes with is divine. I love the sauté jalapeño. It adds the right amount of heat on the simple fish with a killer sauce.  We thought the fish was the bomb until the peppercorns chicken came out. Like OMG! Highly recommend! I didn't care for the Dr. Lee's tea. I wanted to try the tea because someone mentioned that it goes nicely with the spicy food. I didn't care enough for it, especially since it costs about $6 for tea. Overall, great experience. We could only finished half of what we ordered. And the food still tastes amazing the next day. Definitely will be back. Perhaps with a bigger group of people so we can more food from the menu.
