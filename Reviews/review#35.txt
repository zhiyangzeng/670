I usually order take-out, specifically, the Banh Cuon Nhan Thit (fresh rice paper with ground pork). It's nice to be within a 5 minute drive when I'm craving for some Banh Cuon or some other Vietnamese dish, rather than go all the way to Chinatown. I also recommend the Goi Vit dish (Vietnamese salad with duck meat). The quality of their foods always seems fresh.I don't recommend getting the Saturday special, which is the Vietnamese Steak &amp; Eggs. Although it is decently priced ($5-7), the portion is small and everything was oily. I ordered the dish that came with steak, egg, and Vietnamese sausage (that came with literally 2 small pieces of sausage), and a small French bread. I would've enjoyed it more if there were also pate and butter. I won't order that again in the future.Side note: I am not a fan of their Ca Phe Sua Da (Vietnamese coffee). I'm not sure which coffee they use but it is thick, dark, and bitter. Not what I'm usually used to. I wish there were better Ca Phe Sua Da options in EaDo.I've dined here twice and the service was pretty mediocre. It's a step above your subpar service that you would normally get in any Asian establishment in Chinatown, but still lacking. Both times I needed drink refills or something else and would have to either wait a while until someone came to check on me or eventually had to flag a server down.Overall: Food is pretty good and authentic, but dine-in service can be improved.
