Yelp hits a home run with Cooking Girl!!!Was planning a get together with some good friends from SA in Houston during Christmas and I called one of my favorite Sichuan restaurants in town.  To reserve a table they wanted my CC # and $150 min.  Crazy, huh?So I looked on Yelp and found Cooking Girl :)So I called Cooking Girl, they said "no problem" when I asked them if I could reserve a table.  They do charge per bottle for BYOB but I didn't mind.  Better than giving my CC info out.Well, the food was fabulous!!  There was no problem with the wait time.  Every single dish was a hit!  From the appetizer (Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith) to the Green peppercorn chicken, the cucumbers and the TMD soft bacon, every single dish was flavorful and amazing.  We all had blast.  Cooking Girl quickly won our hearts and our stomachs!!! Service was great, even with it being a full house.  I have found a new favorite Sichuan restaurant.
