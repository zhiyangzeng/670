I love the atmosphere and they allow you to bring your own alcohol, but there is a corking fee!!They give you these complimentary chips to start.  I wasn't a huge fan, but I loved that I got to try something new.  The good - Mongolian Beef, Green Beans (my personal favorite Szechuan food)The oh alrightttt - Spicy Cube ChickenThe not so good - Dan Dan Noodles (maybe because I'm not used to cold noodles?), Soft Bacon (everyone on yelp raves about this dish, but my friends and I couldn't understand why?  The texture was weird and so was the taste)Overall, I would come back because of the green beans and to try additional dishes.  Plus, there aren't many Szechuan restaurants inside the loop.
