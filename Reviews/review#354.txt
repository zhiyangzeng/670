Sigh what can I say...I had such HIGH hopes for this place after looking at all of the reviews, and after smelling the place, but at the end of the day, it's best for Amateurs - falls short of great Chinese cooking. Here's my review:1. I got the Ma Po Tofu, green beans, and white lotus dish (which was actually just stir fried cabbage). The flavor was ok, nothing was spicy even though I specified spicy (I mean it's Szechuan cooking), and everything was SUPER OILY, and overly salted. It was Oily to the point where I couldn't eat it...look I know Chinese food is oily, I eat it everyday...I'm Chinese, I lived in SE Asia, and my dad was literally the creator of sauces for PF Changs, so spare me from the cynicism...I know my Chinese - this missed the mark, and worst off, it's nothing near home cooking.2. Kudos on the fast to go service and FRIENDLINESS...the place was nice, organized, and clean. 3. It was packed - am I missing something here? Maybe it's me, Â but then again, it's not...I'm an elitist, and this is subpar for my status...ok just joking, but no not really...
