I came here on a weekday night with a group of friends. It took about 30 minutes to get a table for 8. The restaurant itself is not very big, so the place fills up really fast. It's probably not the best place to eat with a large group, but 2-4 people is perfect. On this particular occasion, we decided to order:Mongolian Beef: best dish! beef was very flavorful and tenderMapo Tofu: average, tofu felt really oily and slimy Hot Diving Fish: spicy and deliciousDan Dan Noodles: one of the best Dan Dan noodles I've triedFried Green Beans: pretty bland, but passableSliced Beef and Ox Tongue: cold salad dish, but very flavorfulFried Chicken Cubes: the majority of the dish was peppers with little chickenOverall, I was pretty impressed with the quality of the food here. The only other comparable restaurant is Mala Sichuan, but the flavors at Cooking Girl are clearly superior with a higher price tag.
