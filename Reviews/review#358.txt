If you want some Real Authentic Chinese food in Midtown this is the place to go. Instead of driving all the way to China town there's a finally a legit place in the greater Houston area. I order four of their Specialty dishes and boy was delicioussssOrganic Dumplings (My Favorite) 5/5Saut√©ed Lamb Meat (2nd favorite) 5/5Rice Noodle seafood Casserole (kinda salty) 4/5Pepper Twins Chicken 1/5 (Too much spices taste so weird)Service was excellent, parking is limited is the the only down side. I will definitely come back and try our more of their dishes.
