My friend sent me an article that named the top 17 Chinese restaurant in America and Houston had one - Cooking Girl. I was like what? Never heard of it. So I went that very same evening to try it out.Boy! Do they have great food! The chef is skillful in getting all the details just right. Freshness is key, then the perfect balance of taste and texture. Just trying a few dish gave me confidence that whatever the chef cooks, it will be just right.We had kids with us so we only tried mild dishes, can't wait to go back for the spicy ones. I only give 4 stars and not 5 because it is a humble little restaurant without the proper atmosphere to truely enjoy a dining experience. But it is definitely 5 stars in its category.BTW, parking is tight and street parking can lead to a broken window. Beware.
