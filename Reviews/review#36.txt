We had the Phoenix chicken, shrimp/pork spring rolls, and duck soup. I've come here multiple times and each time they have great service, are fast, and their prices for the awesome quality you get are fantastic. Â I've taken people here who have claimed to have had Vietnamese in other states and part of the country and they're always blown away.
