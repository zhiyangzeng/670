We went for an early dinner on Saturday at 5:15pm and there was no wait and plenty of places to sit. We have a toddler, so we tend to eat earlier so we beat the crowds.We order the pork belly dish (TMD I think it is how it is listed on the menu), green beans, and the mongolian beef. OMG the mongolian beef was so flavorful. The greenbeans were good, especially with all the meat dishes we had. The porkbelly was good, but I probably would have enjoyed it more if I was eating rice. I can see it being really good with a HUGE bowl of white rice. :)My husband wants to go again! There are a number of things we both want to try!
