It's almost a draw between this place and Tiger den. But ofc here you don't have the dipping noodles as an option. I've never got into the ramen craze like everyone has in the past recent years. So I was really hesitate when my friends decided they want to try ramen during their visit here. Mind you, I was hungover and sick to my stomach. Usually when this happens I am very mindful of what I eat so I mean ramen should be ok. Well it turned out it was way better than I expected. Not only did I manage to eat I was able to finish the entire thing! Definitely proved me wrong to assume ramen was just a hippy tread. Definitely recommend any nonbelievers!
