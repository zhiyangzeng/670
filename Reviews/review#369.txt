Cool little spot. Not being a huge Ramen buff I'm not confident enough to state that it's the best in town but it was good. A lot better than the ramen packets they serve in prison.I stopped in for lunch and was quite pleased. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with baby bok choy and an egg! It was delicious, spicy and lasted me 2 days. Complimentary parking in attached garageFull Bar Booths and long, family style seating availableMake reservations for parties larger than 6
