As a kid I grew up with same style of Ramen, that is cooked with an assortment of ingredients as they offer her at Jinya.  A fundamental and foundation of any soup is the broth and Jinya does a great job from the chicken, pork, vegetable and chicken/pork combinations. The additional ingredients; egg, fried onions, green onions and your choice of chicken and/or pork  coalescing into a wonderful and satisfying dish.  Jinya also offers an assortment of tapas that you can't forget that I would recommend such as the spicy creamy shrimp tempura, jinya bun with braised pork belly and crispy kale lollipops.  As other yelpers have mentioned parking can be bit of a challenge but recommend valeting around the corner inside the residential unit, which payment is based on gratuity.  If you plan on coming during lunch better get here no later than say 11:30 a.m. otherwise seating can be tough, but many times there's room at the bar.  Enjoy!
