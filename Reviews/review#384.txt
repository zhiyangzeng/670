Let me preface by saying that I absolutely do not like Ramen. It was my personal challenge to try something different this weekend and JINYA fit the bill for it. Not only did I like the Ramen but I also liked their appetizers and the egg inside the ramen (don't like eggs all that much either). Based on my photos you can see that the presentation is consistent and the service was wonderful too. The tea was authentic but not sure if it was microwaved or steaming on top of a bunsen burner because when I got my cup it was too hot for me to touch. Like unbearably hot. In my past experiences I have been able to touch these gaiwan like cups but this was just insanely hot. Thankfully my lunch companion liked it and couldn't stop raving about it's authenticity.I tried both Ramen we ordered. The thin noodles were my favorite as it was easier for me to eat them. The thick noodles seemed to be a hit and were enjoyable as well. My favorite part of the meal, however, were the pork gyoza and the shrimp ball. The shrimp ball was perfectly fried with no excessive oil dripping and the cream cheese center filling was just the right amount. The exterior of the shrimp ball was perfectly coated and crispy. The gyoza was fried correctly and the gyoza sauce on the table definitely added to the flavor.This time, we did not get to try the dessert but next time I will definitely be getting my mochi fix.
