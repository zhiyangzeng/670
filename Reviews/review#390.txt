My review will be the 750th review of this restaurant. It kind of makes me wonder what can I say that hasn't already been mentioned in the last 749 reviews of this place? Regardless, I'm still going to write a review just because I'm a Yelpologist, damn it!Parking: Plenty of street parking after 6 pm Monday - Saturday and all day Sunday, or you can park in the parking garage that is shared with other establishments such as 24 hr fitness and Piola. I usually just park in the garage because it's covered.Wait: There was a short wait when I came here for the first time for Sunday lunch. However, we waited for a party of 10 so waiting for 10 spaces to open up did take longer than if you're just coming here by yourself (you could sit at the bar) or if you're in a party of four or less.Service: The guy who was serving our party was pretty cool. He was quick to take orders from all of us (in the end, only nine people showed up) and there was no issues in splitting the check. The only downside was when the food was coming out, they were kind of messed up in delivering the right appetizers to the right person. However, all the ramen bowls were brought out to the right people.Food: I ordered a few things: Crispy Shrimp balls, Wonton Chicken Ramen, with seasoned egg, and Gyozas. The cripsy shrimp balls were delicious. They're kind of like the shrimp balls you get when eating Dim Sum, but not really. The gyozas were pretty legit, but if you really want good gyoza, then head to San Dong noodle in Chinatown. I still think their dumplings are the best in town. As for the ramen itself? DE-LI-CIOUS. I usually don't really like soupy meals, but for this ramen, I definitely could make an exception.So to cut a long review short; easy parking despite being located in midtown, good service, and excellent food. I'm definitely going back to try other items on their menu.
