I have been to Jinya a handful of times now and tried a few of their ramen. Tonkatsu black- this was the first ramen I tried here and honestly, it was so good that I got it a few more times before I tried something new on the menu. The broth was a good tonkatsu broth that wasn't too salty. The pork chashu is my favorite in Houston and always so soft and tender. Tokyo Yatai- I ventured out and tried this on one of my visits, and this was interesting...It is a lighter broth because it has pork and chicken broth. with chicken chashu. You can tell the broth is lighter than the usual pork broth. Still good, but it's not something I'm used to. If you're in the mood for something lighter, I would highly recommend this one. Spicy Miso Tonkatsu - This ramen is full of flavor! The miso adds something extra that makes it different from the tonkatsu. I do think this one's a little salty though. I personally like the thin noodles at Jinya better than the thick, so I always ask them to substitute it. I feel like the thin noodles are more comparable to ramen shops in Japan. This is probably my favorite ramen spot in Houston now! I would highly recommend trying it at least once.
