The only Japanese ramen place I've been to in Houston so far. Heard there are several other good places too but I have not bothered to try other places yet because I am too satisfied with Jinya! Their appetizers are good, their side dishes are good, and of course their ramens are awesome. I'm currently trying every ramen on the menu (and I'm almost there) and seriously all of them are really really good. It's hard to choose one that's my absolute favorite, but it would be chicken yatai for now because I like clear broths. By the way my husband loves tonkotsu black, their number 1 menu. As for the appetizers, all time favorite is their pork bun. This is a must try!My husband lived in New York for a couple of years and tried a lot of good ramen places there and he confirms that Jinya is one of the best. There might be a little wait since this is a popular ramen bar in midtown, but the wait won't be too long so don't miss out the chance to try their ramen.
