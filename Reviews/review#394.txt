This was my first visit to JINYA Ramen Bar. Why? To begin with this type of food is not usually my first, second or third choice when I plan to eat out however I do enjoy eating it occasionally. Â I visited for lunch last weekend and am glad I did. I ordered the Jinya chicken ramen, pork gyoza and salad and finally the crispy shrimp balls. With iced green tea to drink my bill with tax but before tip was about $24. It was a lot of food but gave me the opportunity to do some serious sampling.First to come out were the 4 shrimp balls for $6.50. Seriously, I could have just eaten those and left very happy. They were excellent (5). Crispy on the outside and so yummy on the inside with sour cream and shrimp they were divine! I highly recommend these to you. You will not be disappointed. The salad and pork gyoza showed up next. I thought the salad was good (3.5) and the pork gyoza (like dumplings) were a 3. The big bowl of chicken ramen arrived and it was so chicken noodly good (3.5). I liked it and you will too. If I had to do it all over again, I would have ordered the shrimp balls and ramen again and skipped the gyoza and salad because I didn't need that much food.The iced green tea wasn't exactly what I thought it was going to be. It had more of a cloudy visibility to it. I probably would order something else to drink next time. Table service was very good (4). Parking was easy in the attached free garage. I enjoyed my visit and would be happy to return. I understand why this place is so popular.
