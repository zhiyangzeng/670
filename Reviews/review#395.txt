When it's a cold winter day and I'm craving ramen, my go-to places are Kata Robata, Soma, or Jinya. All three places score evenly in my opinion, but Jinya stands out more because they focus on ramen (not sushi or sashimi).First time goers will usually order the number 1 (Jinya Tonkotsu black $12.95). It's a pork based broth with thin noodles and standard ramen fixings such as nori, seasoned egg, green onion, garlic chips, etc. I like it so I recommended it to my friend who never had ramen before and he loved it.I usually order the chicken ramen ($10.50). The flavors aren't as complex as the other choices, but I like it for it's simplicity. The broth is excellent and the noodles are good too.Garage parking is free!!! Don't be fooled by the valet guy on the first floor. Just go to the second floor and park yourself. If you valet, it will take you more time to get to your car afterwards because walking will be much faster.
