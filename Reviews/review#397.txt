It is great to have a good ramen place that is in downtown Houston. Coming from Seattle, high quality ramen could be found almost everywhere. In the few months that I have been in Houston, I think I've been here almost every two weeks.All of the ramen that I have had was very tasty and quite substantial. If you come here, make sure to differentiate the ramen that has the thin or thick noodles. For me, I prefer the thicker noodles, since I like the bit of elasticity and chewiness that is a bit lacking in the thinner type noodles. The broth, while good, tastes almost like it is made from a paste instead of slowly boiling down the bones and other cuts of meat. The appetizers here are also all very good. It is one of the few places that makes brussel sprouts palatable, and their takoyaki is absolutely amazing. The only thing that I will fault them is that their bar seems to be run by a blind man. Well, I can't say that entirely since the person who hired the bartenders hired some really cute girls. I asked for a simple gin martini, 3 parts gin to one part vermouth. However, the bartender thought I said I wanted two martinis. She also just poured gin into a shaker and shook the hell out of it and served it in a glass..............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................Yeah... You can definitely see that Houston bartenders don't need to be licensed. A gin martini should be one of the first drinks anyone learns how to make. It is also NOT shaken, as James Bond would imply, but stirred. Also, unless you ask for a Churchill martini, which Is just chilled gin, you put vermouth in it. The thing that saved this debacle was that the bartender was committed to high quality service and made the drink again for me and gave me the two others for free. I asked her to try stirring it, but apparently the bar isn't stocked with bar spoons.............. Lesson learned. If you come here, come for the ramen, don't come for the drinks. Either way, however you'll still have amazing service and have a great time
