Soup does the body good, even better when the soup taste good right? Second time coming to Jinya ramen. Came for lou's uye on the second go around. I tried the Vegetable ramen first time here. I think that was the first time I've ever tried ramen, good stuff btw! There isn't very many places who offer a vegetarian ramen so I was not too familiar with it. The ramen is really good here &amp; the veggies make it delish. My second go around consisted with the same. Only this time I added tofu &amp; started with a saut√©ed cauliflower dish. Ramen still righteous, cauliflower was cooked perfectly. A tad oily for my taste, &amp; could have used some more pine nuts but still edible. Parking isnt too bad. There is a parking garage nearby, just make sure to park second level or higher. Service was quick, staff is friendly &amp; helpful. Good place to come hang out, date night, grab a drink etc...
