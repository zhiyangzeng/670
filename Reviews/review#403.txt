Ramen was good! Decided to have dinner here tonight and the wait time was quoted about 20-25 minutes. It went over and the host sat another party that came after us before us. The server we had wasn't so great as well. She actually rolled her eyes when one of my guests had a question about the pork gyoza. All in all, I thought the ramen was good but it wasn't worth the time and service to come back. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
