4 stars for the food~ as most low rated reviews have stated, service here sometimes isn't great, sometimes it's decently okay. Last time i went i ended up splitting the tip with another server who was actually RUSHING over to help us out (refill our water, take more of our orders, getting the check) while ours never even bothered checking up on us.Spicy dipping noodles- 5/5! The thick, spicy, flavorful broth along with the thin dipping noodles is such a nice combination. I would suggest ordering an extra side of noodles just so you can make more use of the broth since it's more of a heavy creamy texture rather than one you can straight up drink from. As far as their appetizers i would suggest either the takoyaki or their brussel sprouts. OH and out of all the times I've been here i FINALLY tried their pandan custard doughnut dessert. Pleaseeee do yourself a favor and order this!! so light and crisp and fluffy along with the custard cream you can dip it into, def a great way to end the meal.
