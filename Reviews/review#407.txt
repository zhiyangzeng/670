This is our go-to place for the dipping noodles. It used to be an off the menu option but I guess it got good reviews and finally made it on their menu. You can order extra noodles on the side of you're like my boyfriend and i. I like to slowly eat my noodles with the broth while my bf dumps all of his noodles in at once. Whichever way you decide you wouldn't be disappointed. The line is fairly long and there's always a nice. They made it pretty convenient with their wait list outside for you to sign in. The setting arrangements are pretty confusing. On a busy night and if you're coming as a couple you're most likely going to be seated in the middle .. elbow to elbow with another couple. So be weary with space.
