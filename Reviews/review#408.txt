Wow, these reviews are all over the place haha. I guess it depends on taste buds, but the food isn't too bad here. I'd give them a 3.5 rating if I could. I ordered their tonkotsu ramen. Pretty standard; there's nothing too special about it. It tastes good. I really like their pandan donut. It's the same as Chinese/Vietnamese fried breadsticks that you add into rice porridge, but instead you dip it in the green pandan sauce and it's quite delicious! Not too sweet and good as a mild dessert to wash down your ramen.This place is crowded for dinnertime and the wait took awhile, but it wasn't anything that would kill you unless you're impatient and don't like waiting at all. Then maybe it might kill you ;) Service was decent for a packed moderately tiny restaurant. Ambience is great. Dim lights with awesome flower firework shaped light fixtures. Super noisy, but you can still hear your table mates talking. I'd come here again to try the other ramen bowls. Not too shabby.
