Tiger Den deserves every award and 5 star review they have received. It is a great den to hangout and have a meal.I have had several culinary experiences with Japanese ramen, but not enough to judge fairly. However, my brother-in-law who lived in Japan for 2 years said it was phenomenal.Everything from the wall decals to the menu options were refreshing and satisfying (I did not know that a wall could satisfy, but it did here).Ramen is highly recommended, also I add the hot oil and chili powder from table for extra H E A T. This was our last mean of 2015, at 23:00 on Dec 31st 2015. It was the perfect place to do so, and a perfect place for lunch or dinner anytime in 2016 and beyond.
