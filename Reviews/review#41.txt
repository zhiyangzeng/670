i visited Jenni's Noodles when it was at it's former location(now Calliope's Po Boy's), and really enjoyed the dumplings.  upon finding out that the new location was close to my husband's client, it was determined this would be a perfect lunch date spot!the parking we are familiar with, so that's no biggie.  we arrived at 12:15 and there was a line, but it moved quickly and the seating was more than accommodating.  my husband recommended the "Mighty Won Ton" Soup, but i was feeling like Pho....he reminded me that his good friend who is Vietnamese mentioned it was very bland.  so i compromised and ordered the MWT Soup, but sub'd the egg noodles for rice noodles...i felt this would give me that Pho experience at least. well, it turns out the MWT Soup is JUST AS bland as the Pho was reported being.  I had to use chili sauce, soy sauce, lemon....everything i could get my hands on to give it some flavor.  I really want to give this place more than 3 stars, because their service is really stellar!  The owners are hands on and make you feel really appreciated.  However, at the tune of $8 for a bowl of soup...u really want to be wowed by flavor.
