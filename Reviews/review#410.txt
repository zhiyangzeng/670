CONGRATULATIONS TO THE TERRIBLE HOSTESS THAT ANNOYED ME SO BADLY WE WALKED OUT OF THE RESTAURANT!!!!!!! (It's the chick with the thick winged eyeliner)Wednesday night. Empty tables. Party of two. Start Scene.Hostess: We have the bar open for you. Can you sit at the bar?**Me: No thanks, we don't want to really sit at the bar. Can we have that table over there instead?Hostess: No. You're only a party of 2.**Me: Well you have three other party of 2 right over there, there, and there so why can't we have a table?Hostess: Well, you came in later than them. We want to save it for a party of 3 or 4.**Me: Okay but you already have party of twos in those tables so that's not really fair. I'm not going to stand outside in the cold and I'm not sitting at the bar.Hostess: You can share that table over there with those 4 people. Good grief. We walked out. I could not stand her. Really put a bad taste in my mouth of this place and we ended up having delicious hot soup somewhere else!
