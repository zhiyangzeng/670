The atmosphere is very nice for a date or a meet up or anything really. The lighting is dim and makes the atmosphere. The garlic black bean is my ultimate recommendation and their appetizers are pretty good, better than other places.But if you order the Shoyu or any of the soups with a lime in it, make sure you take it out because the peel will make the soup bitter at the end. If you like the citrus in the soup(like I do), squeeze the juice out and take it out of the soup.
