I came here when it first opened, especially since it was one of the first. I liked it but didn't like waiting in long line for a table. Hadn't been back there in over a year and had made my rounds to all the other new ramen places that opened up so it seemed like a good time to retry and be able to compare it against the others.Likes:- Pork belly portion: the Tonkotsu comes with three sizable, delicious slices when other places might only give you one- Dipping ramen: this is legit; it's off menu but you can order it; heads up it's SPICY - I'm a wimp and couldn't eat it but husband loved it- Broth/noodle ratio: I love broth and at most places I'm out of broth before I finish my noodles leaving me helpless; they give a good amount of broth!- Service: fairly quick and servers checked in oftenDislikes:- Seating: because they're so busy, they're picky on where you sit; there was only 2 of us and made us sit at the bar...the only table open was reserved for groups 3+; plus side is that we actually ended up liking sitting at the bar and seeing how they made the food- Wait: luckily we went in the middle of the week so not too bad, but weekends can be a pain; make sure to write your name on the board outside to hold your spotWe were so stuffed from our ramen, but having sat at the bar and watching make the food in the kitchen, I want to try some of their grilled items next time - the grilled squid looked awesome...wonder if it's as good as it looks?
