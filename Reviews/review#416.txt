Bad customer experience~let customer wait when they still have table available!We got there at 9:40 Sunday night and that time they still had two booth available, nobody was waiting at that time but the hostess still gave us an attitude and put us wait because we only had two people! And we waited around 40 minutes,but one of the booth was available all the time, when we seated we only spent 30minutes to eat! I just don't get it, y'all close at 11pm, why y'all just let us waste that 40 minutes instead of seat us att he beginning!That's not make any sense to me!
