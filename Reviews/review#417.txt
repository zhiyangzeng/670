My boyfriend has been really suggesting this place and we finally visited it tonight.Service: Awesome! Our server was very helpful and patient in explaining to us about the menu. Also, every server came by in the right time checking on us! It was just nice!Food: we ordered Black bean garlic Ramen and Dipping noodles. The ramen broth was very good. Strong taste of garlic and black beans were crispy. It balanced so well. Also, there were perfect amount green onions and they just went so well with the pork bellies!For the dipping noodle, goodness, the broth was so creamy and flavorful. It's actually like the Dan Dan noodles but they put more Japanese mayonnaise to make it a little more creamy. I know it sounds strange but it's sooooo good. The noodle was very spicy too so be aware! Also. There was some peanuts in the bottom of the bowl and it was such a great combination. We also ordered the chicken skins and pork belly Yakitori as our appetizer....(I know! They added a little something to the reasons of us getting heart attack) the skins were so crispy and perfectly seasoned. The pork belly was okay though.As usually, the five-minute egg was amazing, although I like Ramen Jin's better! Still! With the service and the food, it deserves a five star!
