Smaller than I expected but this place is super cozy. When you walk in you are greeted by a wall. Doesn't bother me, just saying. The hostess sat us in the middle row and then we were given silverware and menus. At that point it was getting a little crampy and my server Alex who is friendly and knowledgeable, got us a booth by the door. They know how to accommodate their customers and that's awesome! I got the dipping ramen which was spicy but sooooo good. We also ordered Brussels sprouts but they ran out. I guess we gotta come back and try next time!
