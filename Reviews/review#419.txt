Some of if not THE best ramen in the area.  It's difficult to quantify what makes it so good but it is.  Very rich and flavorful broth with a high level of attention to detail from the way the 5 minute eggs are marinated to the herb placement.  I belong to a local Ramen group and this is my go-to place.   The thing that puts this place over the edge for me is that in addition to the wonderful ramen and appetizers, the atmosphere is great.  It's a bit dimly lit (which I like) and the restaurant is very updated.  Highly recommend.
