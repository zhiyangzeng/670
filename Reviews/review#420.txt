Don't expect to come here and be seated right away. There will always be a wait but I think it's worth it!You must try their dipping ramen! It was spicier than I expected the first time I tried it but the more I eat it, the less spicy it becomes. I guess because now I expect it. I love spicy so it's perfect for me! Their spicy miso ramen is also good.Appetizer:-the grilled baby octopus is okay. It tastes like barbecue tbh. It was interesting because the head is still attached.-Brussels sprouts are a must get!!!-the fried squid and dumplings are good too :)Dessert:-pandan donuts are so fluffy and good and melt in your mouth omgggg
