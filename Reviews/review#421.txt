Intimate and modern ambience with community seating and booths. Got there 20 minutes before opening and we were the 4th ones on the list! Loved the Brussels Sprouts--had a nice sweet flavor with a kick. Gizzard Yakitori was equally yummy. I'll pass on the grilled squid next time, just wasn't my favorite but still good. Spicy miso ramen was out of this world. Definitely get there early!
