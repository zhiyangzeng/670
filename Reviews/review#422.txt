My brother took me to this ramen shop. I really liked it. We ordered the dipping ramen. Everything was perfect. To start off, get there early for a good seat. There was no wait, we were sat at a communal bench/table. The only bad thing is not a lot of elbow room.Our dipping ramen came out in 10-15 mins. The whole thing was good, a little spicy, but good. My brother ordered an extra side of noodles and chashu. Not a bad idea if you're hungry.:-) the dipping broth is rich and had a little creamy taste. It had chashu, an egg, scallions, and ground pork. Really yummy:-)The staff was friendly and prompt. Checked out really fast too, thought it would take awhile since they were busy.I will return, definitely. The other bowls beside us looked so good. Want to try the tonkatsu.
