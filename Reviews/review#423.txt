I'm so glad I can finally update my review to 5 stars for Tiger Den.  The black bean ramen is my fave and the owners have listened to what their clientele wanted.  Major kudos to them!The black bean ramen is loaded with garlic and and has a richer creamier broth than Jinya's version plus it's only $8 versus Jinya's at $12.95 for their somewhat comparable Black Tonkotsu.  Plus the bowls are filled a lil bit more at Tiger Den.Tiger Den also has quite a variety of fresh grilled apps and changes out some of their apps from time to time to keep their menu fresh and interesting.  They also offer more nightly specials on their special outside black board.I find at this time that Tiger Den has the overall best "Real" broth made with bones and best variety of apps for a ramen shop in the greater Houston area.The service has always been very good to excellent with caring and friendly young people that all work harmoniously together.  It's also nice to be remembered when I go back each time.
