I went with a couple of ramen fanatics so my experience was a little different from theirs (they'd probably rate a 5/5). After an hour wait we were finally seated, it was cold outside, so the standing heating posts were most appreciated. I loved the fried squid balls, the beer they recommended went down smooth then the dipping ramen.. let's just say there's a reason they leave the pitcher of water at the table. That dipping sauce was uncomfortably spicy in my book, but again, the fanatics I went with ate through the delicious pain. The veggy ramen was much more to my taste, I would probably eat here again If I came right when it opened to avoid the wait.
