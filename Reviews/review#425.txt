Excellent food, impeccable service!Start off with the Brussels sprouts tempura, gyoza and salmon sashimi! The salmon is to die for!My friend loves the Cha Cha Cha and I love the vegetarian bowl... Fresh garlic is a must!Close out the meal with the Annin Toful sweet almond pudding, it is amazing!Jinya is def worth the 35 min drive from Galveston!
