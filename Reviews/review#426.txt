I have been to both the Clear Lake location and the midtown location! I personally think the Houston location is a tad bit better. I like the decor and ambience of Yinya. Very modern and feels very intimate.I usually order the chicken ramen soup or the chicken wonton soup. Â The soup has a great flavor which I absolutely love! The chicken.... not so much. I feel like the chicken could have a better flavor. The green tea Mochi ice cream is different.. in a good way. I had never tried it before but I was pleasantly surprised! The texture is different but it is very yummy! Overall Yinya is definitely one of my go to places!
