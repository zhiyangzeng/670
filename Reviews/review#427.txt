This has got to be the worst ramen I ever ate in my life. My temperature of the broth was lukewarm. I ordered the cha cha  which is supposedly for the garlic lovers. Nothing garlic about it. The broth was a thick consistency and was hard to swallow. Noodle didn't taste freshly made the only thing I liked from here was the almond dessert. Will not be back. I will stick with samurai noodle. After reading the comments from the owner, I feel that maybe if you spent more time training your staff instead running different scenarios and replaying videos then you will have a better eating establishment. People are either going to like your food or not. I'm one of those who did not. Constructive criticism is a great learning experience. I stick with my original review. My food was not hot. No steam was rising from bowl. The taste of the broth was gross. I ate all my noodles but left the broth in the bowl.In response to marrisa f. People don't always complain to complain. Why I didn't say anything when I was there? Simple. I didn't like the broth flavor. What would they do? Nothing. People either like something or they don't.   I love how people love to assume things about people they don't even know. Lol.
