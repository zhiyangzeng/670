Decadence for your taste buds!I've never had ramen before, but after seeing a food show I knew I needed to add this to my life.I had the Tokyo Yatai Ramen with added fresh garlic and chicken soboro.The broth has the right amount salt with good hints of chicken and pork.The noodles are cooked well and all the toppings tasted great.  I was slurping this goodness to the last drop.We tried 3 apps- gyoza, shrimp balls, and bun.The bun filled with tender tasty pork.Gyozas had a good sear giving them a lil crispness.  I love the gyoza sauce left on the table.Shrimp balls had a rice crispy type coating giving a good crunch with a creamy center.
