Best place in Southeast Houston for a delicious bowl of ramen!!!Spicy Chicken Ramen - For the chicken lovers!!!! You can choose between mild, spicy, or hot. I like to play it safe so I went mild. Mild has no level of spiciness though. No worries...they have a jar of their house ramen hot sauce at the table so you can create your own perfect bowl of spicy ramen. I added in about 4 scoops of the hot sauce. If you're lazy, then you can just order the "spicy" level and you are good to go. This bowl contains creamy chicken broth (probably miso paste mixed with chicken broth), bean sprouts, and two sliced pieces of moist white chicken meat. I also added in some soft tofu (additional $1.00) and some fresh garlic (FREE!). (9/10)Tokyo Yatai - Chicken &amp; pork broth with two sliced pieces of chicken meat, bamboo shoot, some green veggies, and a halved seasoned egg. The soup is clear so it's not creamy like the Spicy Chicken Ramen. The broth also tastes a bit sweeter but just as perfectly seasoned. You can always customize your ramen by adding more toppings. It will cost you anywhere from 50 cents to $2. My boyfriend loves this entree! (8/10)Vegetable Soup Ramen - For the meatless advocates! It comes with vegetable broth filled with cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, spinach, mushroom, and more green veggies. I know it sounds super healthy but it's super scrumptious too! Don't worry about the ramen being tasteless and bland, because it won't be!!! You can also request chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth. (8/10)The employees are friendly and I have never been disappointed with their customer service. They usually yell out something when guests come in. I'm guessing it's some sort of Japanese greeting. The restaurant looks small but it's actually pretty spacious. Everything looks clean so that's a plus too!
