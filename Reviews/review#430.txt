I have been to both Jina-NASA and Jinya-Midtown, and have to say that the Jinya-NASA location is my favorite!.  I typically order the Tonkotsu Black Ramen, Kale Lollipop (kale tempura) and tempura brussel sprouts -- the ramen has a silky-smooth broth, filled with tender pork slices, delicately seasoned soft-boiled eggs, and thin noodles that have just the right amount of firmness.  One of my favorite things about Jinya-NASA, aside from the food itself, is the consistency in presentation, flavor, temperature, quality, and professional staffing. I usually sit in the bar area where Trevor, is always very courteous, prompt and attentive -- however I have never had anything but excellent service from any of the waitstaff.All in all, if you are looking for somewhere that is classy (yet casual), with excellent Ramen (some of the best I've ever had), and top notch service, Jinya-NASA is the place to go.  It is also my go-to place to take out-of-town guests..
