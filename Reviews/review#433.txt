With high expectations from the other Jinya in Midtown and enthusiasm to try the Nasa Jinya I finally have decided to stop by for some delicious Ramen!At first I was expecting to be crowded, loud, and with little breathing space but as soon as I walked in this location all my thoughts went out the door! First I as kindly greeted by the lovely hostesses, we had a brief conversation since I shared the excitement to see one near this side of town and then learned that it was the original Jinya in Houston! Â I ordered the Spicy chicken Ramen with Medium Spicy and I ordered my Boyfriend the regular Chicken Ramen with toppings on the side. My ramen was amazing, Tasty, spicy, and hot to perfection for a cold winter evening, As for my boyfriend that tried Jinya for his first time also enjoyed it very much as I slowly introduce him new flavors and different cuisines to expand his tatste buds!Before I left I asked about their happy hour specials and the ladies were nice enough to show me their Happy hour menu for future reference because I can assure you I will be coming here once again for some Alcohol and Ramen!
