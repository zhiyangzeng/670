Though the price may seem reasonable, I feel that the portioning is slightly lower than what good ramen establishments would provide. Well, this is coming from someone who's been to Japan, where the average ramen place is godly compared to anywhere here. I will give credit to your broth, though I do wish it was a bit more creamier and tastier. Don't get your ramen spicy btw, it'll ruin the flavor of the ramen. Actually, if you order it normally and add just a spoon of the spicy sauce then you should be fine. The meat slices were pretty dang thin which sort of aggravated me. Mushrooms were decent portioning. Also, usually the egg comes free but I guess not here. This might sound weird too, but the noodles look dumb. The curliness of the noodle makes me think I'm eating packet ramen. I will say however that your noodle texture was not bad at all.Don't come hungry, because your normal bowl of ramen here won't get you full, unless your stomach is the size of a 70 year old (sorry to those 70+ that are able to eat a lot).All in all, I could find absolutely nothing special about this place that distinguishes itself from any ramen places I've been to in my life. If you believe it's unfair that I'm comparing this place to places in Japan, trust me, I'm also thinking of ramen places I've been to in the U.S. too.6/10, would come back when I've exhausted Â my top options of places to eat.
