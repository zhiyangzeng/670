My friend introduced me to JINYA a few weeks ago and so far JINYA RAMEN has been the best ramen place I've been to so far! Although midtown location is closer to home (I haven't tried the midtown location), I decided to visit my friend in Clearlake and I do not regret driving the distance for good ramen! I ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and the broth was really good! Also the noodles were enjoyable with ramen broth. Although my noodles did not come with an egg, it was still really good! In addition, the pork had more meat than fat so I was impressed. The meat was soft and delicious! As for service, our waiter was friendly and took our orders in a timely manner. The food came out maybe 5-7 minutes after ordering. All in all, I would return for more of their delicious ramen!
