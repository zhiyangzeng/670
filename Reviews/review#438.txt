Best ramen in Clear Lake?  By far.  I'm SO excited Clear Lake is becoming COOL and getting restaurants like Jinya.  They are quite unassuming in the strip mall that used to house a favorite Hallmark store.Their tempura fried brussel sprouts are the only way I can get my brussel sprout hating friends and family to eat them.  Pork belly buns are soft and chewy, albeit a touch pricier than I'm used to at other places.  Out of the ramens I've tried (Tonkatsu assari, tonkatsu white, cha cha cha), the Cha Cha Cha garlic one has been the standout while the other 2 have just been good.  The company got the spicy chicken, devoured it, so I assume it is good.  Also the spicy bean sprouts aren't really spicy at all, so no worries on that front!There are very few tables that are individualized, most is communal seating which I've gotten used to as a trend these days.  However, about half the chairs are stools without backs which can be challenging for older folks.  I love sitting at the back ramen bar and watching the boxes full of noodles become savory, delicious masterpieces.
