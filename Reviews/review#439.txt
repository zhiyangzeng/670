My first visit to Houston and my friend was raving to me about this place. It was so amazing! We went during happy hour and is aw that they had takoyaki as part of the special! I've never had takoyaki in the states and I must say it was amazing! I ordered the #1 ramen and added the recommendations - best decision. The broth was perfect with flavor and they brought it out nice and hot. We may or may not come back here again before o go back home.
