DELICIOUS.  And likely to satisfy vegetarians and non-vegetarians!  For vegetarians - the salt-n-peppery tofu, gingery tofu, and lemongrass tofu are all really great!  They have some vegetarian soups as well - the Angry Udon (which was a little too angry for me - water!!!), and faux pho, which I haven't had the opportunity to try yet! Not a ton of parking, but I've always managed to find parking and order pretty quickly!
