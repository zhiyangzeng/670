I was super hungry and was expecting a lot more from this place. Food: I ordered the fried chicken (karaage), takoyaki, and spicy tonkatsu. I LOVED the fried chicken and the takoyaki but I was disappointed in the broth of the ramen. It was very one dimensional and not thick enough. I just tasted a lot of salt and a little spice whereas I was expecting a little bit of warm tangy spicyness followed by the aftertaste of type savory meat that you can taste when the broth has been simmering with the meat for awhile. The noodles were the perfect chewy and thin texture though (I chose the thin type of noodle) but it was not enough to save the Ramen altogether. Atmosphere: Loved the open space and big table in the middle for big groups or for community dining. Service: very fast and friendly, Side not: they also have happy hour every day from 3-5, even on weekends and it includes food and alcohol.
