We have been here a few times and it's ALWAYS perfection!  Good vibe all around. Staff super friendly, and kitchen staff very clean and organized.  The appetizers are super tasty. The Crispy Shrimp Balls, the Crispy Kale Lollipops are a big hit. The Jinya Bun is a pork surprise that melts in your mouth!!!!  The latest appetizer  we've had was the Salmon Cilantro Sashimi and OMG, it's so fresh and delicious it'll be ordered every time we come back. My favorite Ramen soup is the Tokyo Yatai Ramen. It has pork and chicken clear  broth and thin noodles. Superb! I definitely recommend this place!
