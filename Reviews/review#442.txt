I think this is my favorite ramen in Houston to date. There is a sense of confidence in the establishment when you dine here--nothing experimental. The staff is adequately trained and the decor is awesome. If anyone has been to Ippudo in NY this is a little reminiscent of that kind of atmosphere, trendy for sure but without having to dress up. - I got the Tonkotsu Black. The broth is great, savory, and more complex than any I"ve had in Houston. The egg is cooked to perfection. This is where Samurai fell short with their cold, overcooked egg. - We also got a couple of pork steamed buns, well cooked and great flavor but a little heavy on the mayo for my preference. - Muiishi Makirritos still does it best. Also the fried chicken was a great surprise. I will definitely be back.- bonus, you don't have to pay extra for sauces. it's on the damn table if you want a little more heat. huge plus these ramen days.
