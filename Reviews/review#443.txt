I've spent a decent amount of time working in this area over the last few months, and Jinya is one of my favorite restaurants to go to for lunch. It's kind of a hidden gem. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but the interior is very nicely decorated, and both the food and service are top notch. I usually order the Tonkotsu Ramen or or the Spicy Ramen. The service is generally pretty quick. Great place to eat with a small group of people.
