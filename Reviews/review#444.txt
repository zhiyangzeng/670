Finally a ramen spot in the Southeast! I definitely had to check this place out, and it did not disappoint. We had a party of three and were seated immediately at the ramen bar. The place was almost at full capacity when we arrived Friday evening, but people ate and left, which definitely helped getting people in and out. I had the JINYA No. 2 Â Spicy Chicken Ramen with a spice level of "Spicy." The noodles were cooked perfectly. The chicken was soft and full of flavor, not tough or dry at all! The broth had so much umami and was seasoned perfectly! There is three level of spiciness for this dish, and the waitress said that the highest level would burn my mouth. I played it safe and went the second level of spiciness, which was good, but I did end up adding more of their spice sauce. If you love spicy food like I do, don't be afraid to get the "Hot" level! One of my brothers got the Tonkotsu Assari which is the ramen with a pork broth, and he devoured that! Hrs normally picky so that says a lot. My other brother got the Pork Chachu bowl which is rice with pork. Nothing special but still seasoned well. This is a ramen place after all, so go for the ramen! Lol..The chicken ramen doesnt come with the seasoned egg, but I say spend that extra $1 for the egg!! Super delicious. Plenty of parking because the restaurant is located in a big strip. It is at the corner of the strip, so it's not hard to find either. My goal is to try every ramen that they have, so I will definitely be back!
