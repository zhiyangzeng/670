What a nice place! I love the ambiance and the music they played. I went with a girlfriend and we got the takoyaki, which we both enjoyed! Tip: Do not stick the entire thing in your mouth. It was so hot when I got it (duh) so I couldn't enjoy my first one since I was too busy trying to air out my mouth.I got the spicy chicken ramen (hot) with fresh garlic (you need to crack the garlic yourself with this weird contraption they give you) and the broth was really tasty! The chicken was a bit too salty. I don't know if I would say it's the best, but it's definitely something I would get again.Service was great! I hope they plan to stay open until 4AM on weekends, because it'd be the perfect place to go after a night of drinking.
