By far my absolute favorite ramen spot in Houston! I was a bit hesitant to try it out after learning that it was a chain, but I was so pleasantly surprised to say the least. The menu boasts a large selection of different ramen options and having tried many of them, I can say they're all pretty great. Extra pork chasu is a must!! Out of the small bites/appetizers, definitely try the shrimp balls, the Jinya bun, the fried chicken and the potstickers! The communal seating and menu are very reminiscent of Momofuku. Prepare for long wait times, especially on peak nights. Definitely a MUST TRY if you dig great ramen.
