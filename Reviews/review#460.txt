During my recent visit to Houston, on a very cold Sunday evening (It was only 44 degrees!) my cousin and I decided we need something hot and soupy. He has been here before and figured I'd like it. He was right!I didn't know what to expect so was very surprised to see how packed it was. The hostess told us the wait would be about 15 min, and we were fine with sitting at the bar up front if that's faster, but we did get seated in about 10 min. We got a cozy booth for 2. I did notice there were 2 community tables in the center, which I like because that means you can have big groups, or it might be fun to share the table with strangers. Maybe.My cousin and I both ordered the Cha Cha Cha (pork broth), but he usually gets the Tonkotsu Black. We also ordered the Pork Gyoza &amp; Salad combo. The gyoza wasn't too bad, though a bit salty. The skin was moist and I like the pronounce taste of scallion. The salad was better than I expected because it was made of baby spring mix instead of head lettuce.About 15 min after our apps we got the ramen bowls. The bowls were quite large and filled almost to the top. I knew right away I'd like this ramen better than the ones in Tampa because there are 2 slices of pork chashu (vs 1) and a whole egg (vs 1/2). The broth is thick, fatty has so much flavor. I couldn't stop slurping when I first got served. The noodles were cooked on the firm side, which is exactly how I like my noodles. Jinya just got another fan.I don't have much experience in ramen, but I do know that the ramen here is absolutely to my taste. I am absolutely obsessed with Jinya.
