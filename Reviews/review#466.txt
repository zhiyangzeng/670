Alright.. I was really excited to try this place out so I didn't mind waiting for 30 minutes cause it was a Saturday during the dinner rush and the place just opened 2 weeks ago.  The give you a buzzer so you can walk around.. No big deal.The restaurant was pretty modern, two large tables for communal seating and then sections on both sides.  Pretty small place. Service was quick and staff was nice.  The takoyaki came out first and wow!! They were amazing! The egg sauce they put on the bottom with the bonito flakes made the dish! Best takoyaki I've had! Then comes the disappointment.  The crispy chicken was too salty, not as crunchy as I'd like and was just meh.  The pieces are pretty big so get the smaller count if you're not too hungry.  I've had better chicken.  The ramen.. I ordered the tonkotsu black and it wasn't good. The broth was thick and pretty bland.  I had to add garlic, the ramen sauce, and chilli flakes into my bowl.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and the egg was poached correctly so it was runny.. But the flavors were a disappointment.  The pork was soft but again not spectacular.We also ordered the Annin Tofu dessert and it was good.  Just a sweet almond pudding, very light in flavors, with whip cream and fresh fruits and a cherry/strawberry syrup on top.  Not spectacular but good.Sadly, I really wanted to like this place.. But I don't think I'd be back.
