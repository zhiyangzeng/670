I was pretty pleased with all the dishes that we ordered. We started off with:-brussel sprouts tempura w/truffle oil: tasty but personally, I would've like some sort of dipping sauce to go with it.-quinoa salad: refreshing and I liked the dressing-french fries with truffle ketchup: good crunchy texture and salted well (the way I love my fries)-takoyaki: pretty good, but I've had better.For the entree, I ordered the No. 1 tonkotsu black with fresh garlic topping. The broth was good and flavorful, and I loved the thin noodles. No complaints there!As for the service, I have to say there was more to be desired. Our server wasn't terrible but she wasn't great. We never got our water refills and we felt like she could've been more attentive. My friend brought a birthday cake for me and gave it to a staff member to put it in the back until the end. When she brought the cake out, it was still in the box, with the candles still in its box, and it was warm. -_-All in all, I would return again, especially since it's convenient and the food is worth it. I just hope they'll improve on the service in the future.
