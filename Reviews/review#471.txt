There's a great atmosphere @JINYA with the crowds buzzing and trendy decor. JINYA has all of the perfect "hardware" to create a great ramen restaurant, but is seriously lacking in software. Service was poor. Our waiter brought us cold water (it was a chilly Houston night) and when we requested hot water, he said, "We don't have any." He had actually realized that he forgot to bring us hot water about 15 minutes back and was lazy enough to tell us there wasn't hot water. Sure enough, when we asked another waiter for hot water, three steaming mugs came right back. Our waiter seemed to be more concerned with his conversation with another waitress than attending to his tables...Ramen here okay priced ($15-20 per person). I've had better ramen in SoCal for half the price. If you expect authentic Ramen coming to JINYA, you're bound to be sorely disappointed. There's MSG in the broth, lots of fusion (which I'm fine with), and the Ramen lacks the chewiness and perfection in texture that Japan is famous for. Will not return.
