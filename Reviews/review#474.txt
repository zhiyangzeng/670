The only reason I'm giving Jinya 5 stars is because of Ruben. Don't get me wrong, their food is solid. Ramen is flavorful and noodles are dank af, but both times we have eaten here service has been spotty. The first time we ate at Jinya was in March and we sat at the bar. The bartender was nice but distracted and on her phone a lot, so Ruben stepped in and gave us great service. This time around we were seated at the communal table and hangryness began to set in after five minutes of no one coming to even get our drink order. But Ruben came to rescue again! We got our delicious appetizers and ramen quickly. So thank you Ruben! You make the service at Jinya exceptional!Recommend their Spicy Miso Tonkotsu Ramen, Pork Gyoza, and Crispy Shrimp Balls.
