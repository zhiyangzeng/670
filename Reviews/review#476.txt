Oh my gosh, this place's service was amazing. I had to give them 5 stars for their service and delicious ramen. My server was name either Kevin or Kenny, I wish I could remember. He was so nice and attentive, even when he walked away he said he would be back in a few minutes. I ordered the spicy tonkotsu, you can choose from mild, hot, or spicy. There are also sides that you can order from tofu, bok choy, and corn (additional cost though) I've tried tiger den and ramen Jin, but this is by far the best ramen place in Houston!
