A clear winner but if you go on a weekend - go early or be prepared for a 30+ minute wait. During the week as it is such a large place - you shouldn't have a wait.Service quick and food out quickly.Well you came for the ramen and you won't be disappointed. Had the 'hot and spicy" chicken - medium (pretty hot) w/ seasoned egg. Hot, tasty, and filling.Started with their kale lollipops which were pretty good - remember you are starting with kale.Beer goes well with ramen. A shortcoming in that they list only 5 "craft" beers and the listed Karbach wasn't available.A good spot - try it.
