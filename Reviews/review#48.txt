One of my go-tos when I'm craving noodles. Highly recommend the pho soup, ramens and curries. Always order for pick up. The order is usually ready in about 15-20 min although they will tell you 10. Service is so-so. But it's cheap, quality, quick and makes me happy.No Sriracha with the togo orders. Better have some at home. But who doesn't?
