If this is the best Ramen in Houston, I guess I'll stick to Pho for my noodle souping.I ate here on two occasions. When a friend suggested it the second time I was hesitant. I remembered I was underwhelmed by the lack of any flavor in the broth besides salt, and the subpar quality of ingredients. The second time was no different. Shortly after I vowed never to come back here and waste my money, a friend became sick after eating here. A good soup is supposed to give you a warm feeling of being loved. This soup gave my friend norovirus instead.
