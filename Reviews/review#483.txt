We went for our Weekly office lunch And this place is definitely getting on the rotation. I was a little hesitant to go out for ramen, but this is definitely not what we had in our dorms during undergrad.  The restaurant was cool &amp; the staff was super friendly.I had the #3 with some dried seaweed and it was great! A lot of garlic, which I really like, but I probably could have held off on one clove.  Everybody enjoyed their Ramen, and I'm trying the #1 next.
