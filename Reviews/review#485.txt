Ordered the Jinya Tonkotsu No. 1 with the recommended corn and the Takoyaki for appetizer. I have never had Takoyaki before, but I loved the fluffy light consistency and what I think was egg spread on the bottom of the plate. The sauce tasted a little like BBQ sauce, but it worked well together. There was a total of 6 of these little balls and I had to stop at two because I was getting full and needed space for the ramen.The ramen is hard for me to explain because I am pretty sensitive to grease. The Tankotsu had a lot of floating grease (orange grease....) and the soup definitely tasted greasy. The pork tasted oven roasted which made it really tender and juicy. The recommended corn fit perfectly with the creamy soup. I say creamy, but the soup itself was not thick. I think I just ordered the wrong thing because pork is known to be greasy and I should have really considered that when ordering. Next time I go, I'll be getting a miso or vegetable soup base. They have all kinds of add ins for your soup if you want to jazz it up some!I probably would come again.
