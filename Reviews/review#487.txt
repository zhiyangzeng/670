I'm giving this place four stars for the atmosphere and service. However the ramen itself was kind of a disappointment after reading all the praise on yelp. I'm from the Washington DC area and I'm not ramen connoisseur but I've had better ramen from a whole foods super market as well as another super market in San Diego. I ordered tonkatsu black and the soup was pretty bland, noodles a bit soggy and the pork lacked flavor. What was nice about their ramen was that they did take their spice levels seriously! So if you like spicy ramen this is a must try. I'm not saying the food was awful but it could use a bit more flavor and seemed relatively new so they have room to improve and grow. Â The service however was phenomenal, our server Ruben, was great! Really down to earth and quick with refilling our drinks and whatever our needs were. With his positive attitude it really did radiate throughout the restaurant. The whole restaurant atmosphere is great, very relaxing and comfortable! If I was staying here much longer I would possibly return and maybe try the spicy miso since that's what I usually order!
