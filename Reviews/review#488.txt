Thank god for Jinya because now there's a ramen shop closer to me and it just became my favorite! -atmosphere: this place was beautiful from the moment you step in to the moment you get seated. It's so beautifully decorated! And I lose how they have tables that are big enough for a large group to tables that are small enough for an intimate date. -service: the wait staff was awesome! Everyone was attentive and the friend I was with determines good staff by how attentive they are with his water refills. He drinks a lot of water and I'll tell you this, it was like a magic trick because every time his cup hit below the half mark, instantly there was someone there to refill it. I understand that this is one of the things the manager strongly pushes and we love it. RAMEN: I have tried plenty of places when eating ramen. I always order spicy miso and I have to say this place was my absolute favorite. The broth wasn't too salty and it just felt so soothing. It was amazingly delicious. The ramen noodles were my favorite. They were thick noodles that were the perfect consistency. I also love how the meats were in small chucks! It's just a preference because I don't like biting into things but I rather have them bite size.-My only complaint here is that the bowls don't come with an egg. You order it separately and its a whole egg. I like biting into half an egg and not a whole one, let alone it being a cold egg. That was weird for me so maybe next time I'll ask them to give me half an egg and the other half to my accompaniment. Also the egg tasted like coffee to me, is that weird? It just wasn't my night for the egg so I didn't finish eating it. Overall love this place!! It was so good and a great place that I'll definitely return!
