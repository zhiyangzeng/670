I feel bad writing this review, but I'll be frank:$9 Pho (2/5)Wasn't feeling it. It wasn't horrible, but if you want a good &amp; true bowl of pho, you may want to make your way to Bellaire. The drive out the loop is worth it if you're looking for the real thing.$5 Teaser Chicken Soup (0.5/5)Eek. The rice didn't taste like jasmine rice, and was very tough. Flavor was bland. Feel bad to say it, but this dish was prettyyyy bad.Those are the only two dishes we tried, so maybe I'll have to try others some time. Overpriced menu, but they can get away with it because of their location. Parking is scarce and tight.Good things about this place is the friendly service and the huge water cups.
