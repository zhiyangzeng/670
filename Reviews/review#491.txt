Really enjoy this place! Not even a big ramen fan but this place may have converted me. I don't like red meat so having a chicken broth option with chicken meat is such a plus for me. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen and it was delicious. WARNING: DO NOT GET SPICY, get mild. I can take spicy food but wow the spicy was way too hot. The waitress said it was a slight kick but I do not agree. My lips def feel numb and it was so spicy the broth was undrinkable. Being the second level of spicy I thought it wouldn't be too bad. Not sure if my plate was bad or something...We also tried the curry and salad and both were refreshing! Obviously the ramen here is the star of the show.Would be a 5 but service was lacking. First was the waitress who recommended a way too spicy level. My BF thought it was unbearable to the point that he couldn't even eat it. It hurt the back of my throat if I drank too much. It also took 30 mins to get our food...considering we were there at 3 pm it should not have been that slow. Waitress also did not come and check if everything was good. Like I said, it was not busy.
