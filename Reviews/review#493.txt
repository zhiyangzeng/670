I came here for dinner with my friends the other night and was pretty impressed. Definitely better than other places I've been to for ramen. We had the brussel sprouts tempura, takoyaki (octopus balls), and pork bun. I wasn't a big fan of the brussel sprouts but probably because I prefer them not fried and with more flavor. The takoyaki and pork bun I do recommend. We also each ordered jinya no 1 tonkotsu black (thin noodles) which you can request the level of spicy. I ordered the hot and found there was a kick at the beginning but wish it could have been a little spicier overall. The broth itself with the seaweed egg etc was pretty good. I would definitely come back here for ramen and probably include more toppings as well as up the level of spicy.
