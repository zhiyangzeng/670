As an ex-CIA agent, I can definitely say that if you want noodle soup and a dance club, this is the place to go.  The noodles and broth were  ok but it really was the garlic hot sauce that was the stand out. Muy bien.  A couple of tips:  Normally, I like to eat french fries that cost me one dollar. But, I was happy to pay four extra dollars for the truffle ketchup.  Not really, but ok.  The government routinely overpays for normal stuff so I felt like I was back at the Pentagon.Also, the house cold sake is great if you like Zimas or Wine coolers.  If you don't, then order something else.  Overall, I thought it was good.  It's not comparable to Momofuko or Ippudo, but hey, Houston ranks top three restaurant cities now.
