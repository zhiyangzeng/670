Ramen is so controversial. Everyone gets so up in arms about the quality, or the flavor, or how you're properly supposed to eat it. I've seen people get verbally assaulted for saying one place is better than another.I'm like- that's some damn good noodle soup.JINYA has the Houston area in awe of their traditional bone broth and their variety of ramen offered. The quality is exceptional and the portions are bordering on superfluous. My spicy miso ramen was a crazy good but not quite as spicy as I usually prefer and so I added chile oil to get it up to par. That stuff is sinus clearing so adders beware. The dumplings were... alright. Really fell flat and filled us up unnecessarily before the main event hit the table.The venue was small and we sat at a large multi seat table that was around where the glass rocks were. The stools got pretty uncomfortable after a while but I assume that is also a tactic to get asses out of chairs in a timely manner to accommodate more patrons.  We showed up at about 1:30 on a Sunday and I was sure we were going to wait. Nope, walked right in. They serve local craft beer on tap... that is always a double plus in my book. They also have some schmancy cocktails and fountain drinks. It's a little on the high side of any lunch budget. I could see this being an optimal date night experience, you know, if you're comfortable slurping up noodles and potentially dribbling broth down your shirt.  I have no shame in eating.
