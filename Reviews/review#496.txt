I got the Tonkotsu black #1 and it was terrific. Comparing this to Ramen Tatsuya back in Austin, they both have their pros and cons. Tatsuya pork was more seared and melted in your mouth, it was one of my favorite parts of Tatsuya. The meat here was tender, but not as flavorful and no seat or color ok the meat. The soup here trumps Tatsuya slightly. I think the soup at Tatsuya leaves me very thirsty afterwards, but this soup was flavorful with heavy pork flavors yet still light. Service was extremely slow, which is why I'm giving it a 4. We came at 3pm when it was fairly dead, and got a table immediately. However, it took 30 mins for our ramen to come out. Â Ramen is usually a fast dish to prepare and should not have taken that long.
