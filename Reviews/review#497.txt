A great experience from beginning to end: and then some.The ambiance this place has is amazing. Walking in past 10 for a late meal on a Saturday night, this place felt great. Beautiful interior design, great music playing, and tons of energy. Roasted cauliflower and warm sake were a great way to start our meal. My wife had a kiwi cocktail that was also exceptional. The possibilities are endless when it comes to ramen, and being our first time, our waiter gladly pointed us in the right direction.My wife forgot her purse and didn't notice until later the next day. We called and they had it waiting for us.
