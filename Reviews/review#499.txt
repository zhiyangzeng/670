We came in a Cold Tuesday night. There was a wait, but we find some stools at the bar and ordered us a round while we wait. The bartenders were busy, yet polite. I had three olive cherry with water on the rocks. I can't really judge the drinks by that now huh!? Pretty hard to mess it up. However, my girlfriend I was with ordered the lychee martini and I tried a sip. It as pretty tasty. Prices of drinks weren't bad. I'd say your average $5 domestic and about $8-$10 mix drinks. We finally got a seat at the big table. Yes it's a big long table that takes the length of the main dining room pretty much. It's like family style seating. We sat with other people as well. It's not s round table or like a hibachi grill table. It's just a long big marble top table. There were pretty lights hanging above the table which gave a nice relaxing vibe. The setting was comfy and casual. It would be bad if you dressed up a little more, but for a Tuesday it was dressy casual/ casual. I ordered the spicy chicken ramen with a seasoned egg. The ramen was tasty, spicy, and had good soup to noodle ratio. That's important! For dessert I tried the tofu parfait and I'll give that a 2 out of 5. It wasn't bad, just probable not my thing. They say it's the most popular dessert. Overall I really enjoyed this place. Good ambience, good food, and nice wait staff.
