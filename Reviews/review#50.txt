We ordered Jenni's (first time eaters) via the Favor app (first time Favor users!). I was so, so looking forward to my lemongrass tofu, as one of the places I miss eating at the most is Tram's in Pittsburgh. Anyone who has ever eaten Tram's will back me up. It's the best. And their lemongrass tofu? Shut up. Anyway. We order the crispy disco pork dumplings, the Verm ginger chicken, the above mentioned lemongrass tofu, and JJ's Slippery Noodles for our four year old. The dumplings were okay. Nothing special. My honey's Ginger Chicken was dry, bland, and had all of two jalape√±os. My lemongrass tofu was completely flavorless. It was almost like they forgot to sauce it. Not an ounce of lemongrass flavor. I was so sad.The standout dish was my son's Slippery Noodles. They were cooked perfectly, the sauce was savory and flavorful, and the chicken wasn't dried out. I would order this for myself. It's a sad thing to have the best meal come off the children's menu. While I WILL use Flavor again, I won't be ordering from Jenni's Noodles.
