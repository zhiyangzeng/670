This place is ok . I like the food but it is kind of expensive for not getting much of anything except for rice granted I did get the salt and pepper tofu it's a pretty simple and basic dish but I got 10 pieces of 1/2 by 1 inch cubes of tofu for $10 over a bed of what looks like 1.5 to 2 cups of rice . Other dishes are probably more elaborate seeing that mine literally had only three ingredients I can understand why it looks kind of sparse. It's kind of unfortunate it doesn't look like the prices change if you were to change it to a vegan options so if you were to get something that has shrimp in it that cost $15 if you were to change it to a vegan option I think you would still pay $15. tofu rice and vegetables are not expensive so to charge the same price as may be shrimp or chicken is a little outlandish. ( was that the proper use of that word lol) . Pricing Â aside I had good service I would really like to go back and try more dishes I've tried two so far but for being a hole in the wall noodle shop and having PF Chang or Carrabba's prices I don't think I'll be going back lol but I would love to see this vegan friendly place have a fountain drink station that is full of naturally sweetened products like torchy's tacos.
