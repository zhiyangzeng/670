Wow.  I have lived near this restaurant since it opened, and have always wanted to try it.  My kids, who eat anything, had tried it previously and have repeatedly tried to dissuade me from same.  Nonetheless, I gave Jenni's a shot.  Mistake.I went with one other person at lunch.  One of us ordered the chicken soup, the other Super Duper Fried Rice.  Service and wait time were fine.  But the food, whoa the food.  The soup smelled DISTINCTLY like wet dog.  Honest to goodness, if I had a blindfold on, I couldn't have been positive I wasn't at the groomer waiting to pick up our pets.  The taste, simply inedible.  Minus two or three spoonfuls, the rest remains in the bowl it was served in.  The fried rice was so hard and overcooked, and the meat and vegetables therein so tasteless and unmistakably unfresh and past their prime, that this dish too was not for human consumption.  The cost for these two dishes and two bottles of Smart Water:  $31.Not only will I not be returning to Jenni's, but as a public service to Montrose residents, will join my kids in affirmatively warning people to stay away.The one star is generous and because the guy that took our order at the register was pretty nice.
