I get the Miso Ramen. Always amazing. In fact, just writing this review is making me consider changing my lunch plans. The only thing that would make it better would be if we could get a soft-boiled egg but that's not an option. Either way, it's a ramen-loving vegetarian's dream!On the other hand the service can be a little slow and sometimes you or your lunch partner will get their meal far in advance of the other. Makes eating awkward and rushed for the guy who got their food last. I get over it and you will too once you eat here!
