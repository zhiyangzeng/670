The food was mediocre at best. Sorely disappointed. The staff was wonderful and nice but it just doesn't make up for the less than food. I ordered the lemongrass tofu and veggie dumplings. Tofu was fair but udon noodles wrecked the dish along with too much lemon. The dumplings were nothing more than dough filled with diced mushrooms and steamed. The vegan cookies are good! Definitely not worth the $.
