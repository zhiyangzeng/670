I've been here several times and it never disappoints. The girl at the register, Mossie is THE nicest and very attentive. She's very knowledgeable about the menu and how to make changes to fit a Gluten Free or Vegan lifestyle. The food is great and there is a variety of different things to chose from. The vermicelli bowl and pho are my favorite and you can always take out the noodles and substitute lettuce for a healthier option. The only con about this place is the parking. There aren't many spots available. It's a small lot that's hard to get into if you drive a normal "Texas sized" vehicle. Lol.
