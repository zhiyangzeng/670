Appetizers are good (hence 2 stars). Otherwise nothing exciting. The shrimply curry dish has nothing to offer...no depth of flavor just a kick of spice at the end. This dish was also one of the most expensive dishes. Replaced it for the ginger chicken dish...still meh. Flavors are not developed AT ALL. There's no love in this food. Probably why it comes out so fast. Nothing authentic about this place.
