I feel like everything about this place should be 5 stars, except perhaps the food. I love the location, the people, and the atmosphere. It is such a casual, friendly place, and this alone makes you want to come back again and again. As for the food, I'm sometimes really impressed and sometimes not so much. I really like the Super Fried Rice. I think it has great flavor and comes in a large portion. I should learn from my mistakes and not try to experiment with other dishes. I should be more loyal to the fried rice. I've also had the vermicelli with lemongrass beef. I wasn't a huge fan, but I can see how some people would like it depending on your taste. Â The beef really lacked flavor. I prefer less lean and more seasoned beef, but I know people who really enjoy lean. It really depends on your taste.I will definitely be back for the fried rice.
