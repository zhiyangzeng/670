I ordered delivery from Jenni's Noodle House via my Favor app, and the food was less than stellar. The orders looked as they were described on the menu, and the portions were a good size, but the taste and texture of the food was not good at all.I ordered the Art Car Curry and shrimp spring rolls. The Art Car Curry has the consistency of water, it is VERY RUNNY. It's loaded with carrots, tofu, and potatoes but the chunks were so big, it was just an annoyance to have to cut them up in smaller pieces. The watery curry has very little spice or flavor of any kind, so definitely a huge disappointment. The shrimp spring rolls tasted good but only after I took the shrimp out! The shrimp pieces were so slimy and mushy, I don't even know want to know what they did to prepare them.It was a pretty unsatisfying dinner, I will not be eating at Jenni's again.
