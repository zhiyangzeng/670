I love noodles! First time here, just randomly drove by, and was happy to find that this place has lots of vegetarian options. I had the vegetarian dumpling teaser (2 steamed dumplings), seaweed salad, and the vegetarian pho! Â Good food overall except the "seaweed" salad should have more seaweed than cucumber.. The entire plate has chunks of cucumbers sprinkled with some seaweeds...I think it should have been called "cucumber salad instead.... no?! ... Regardless, I will definitely be back, and perhaps try out their other locations in Uptown, and in the Heights!
