2nd time we went I got the green curry but was disappointed. Not as flavorful as my other go to Thai place so I would recommend sticking to the noodle dishes! Curry is not as thick as other places either. Almost like a water base but still has flavor.Pad Thai was still spot on and egg rolls so I'm leaving 4 stars again!
