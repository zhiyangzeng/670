I have always loved this spot and even after the change in ownership it is still basically the same.  Same chief I believe, and basically the same menu and all excellent.  Tables up front, then the market with a ton of items.  Most of which I am unfamiliar with, just cause, you know I am a white guy.  I just know I love me some simple stir fry. curry, or any kind of noodles like Pad Tai.  All really well priced and portions to fill you up.  Add the great Thai Tea with cream and I am a happy and filled man.  Don't sleep on the papaya salad or the special whole fried tilapia either.  Quick service, and everyone here is really down to earth and friendly.  They continue to be one of my favorite all encompassing "Asian" stops in Houston.
