<p itemprop="description" lang="en">So... I can't remember the names of most of my dishes! Vietnamese is pretty hard to pronounce. I had the #5 appetizer, and the mi quang noodle dish. Both were pretty delicious and I'd do them again.<br><br>A friend had the tofu curry, but I wasn't a huge fan. It was a little too sweet for me, I'm not a huge fan of sweet curries. <br><br>The service was very friendly, polite, and quick for our group of 10. They split the check at the front efficiently, and I always appreciate when they don't make you feel bad for splitting. <br><br>I'd go back if I was in the area :).</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
