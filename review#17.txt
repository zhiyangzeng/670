<p itemprop="description" lang="en">I happened to be in the area and decided to drop by. I ordered a Pho Dac Biet large bowl. The broth was just right but a little oily. $10 is a bit much for a bowl of pho but then I realized i'm downtown so naturally the prices for food would be higher. At least the interior decor looks nice and not the typical decor I see at most Vietnamese restaurants. I guess I'm paying a little bit more for the ambiance.</p>
