<p itemprop="description" lang="en">The short ribs were succulent and tender. I'd also recommend the crispy egg roll and the baby bok choy with garlic. Incredible flavours and VERY quick service. <br><br>I also enjoyed the chargrilled pork b√πn bowl. Wish I had room for dessert, but left stuffed and satisfied.</br></br></p>
