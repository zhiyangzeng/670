<p itemprop="description" lang="en">Dear Fed Ex,<br><br>Can you please ship me a weekly supply of the refreshing egg noodle chicken soup filled with scallions and bok choy and topped off with lime and jalapeños? It was as if heaven set up camp inside my mouth.  I was sad when after I slurped up the last spoonful. Can't there be more? Tomorrow? Tonight for dinner? Again, again!<br><br>Beyond the refreshing flavors, you'll love this downtown Vietnamese spot for the great service, menu that broadens your definition of "Vietnamese cuisine" and well, again, the flavors. While I have your attention, I'd also like to recommend the Vietnamese coffee (chocolatey and served with sweet and condensed milk), and #5 pork crepes. <br><br>Last, but not least, this restaurant was introduced to me by my future mother-in-law, Melissa, who is known by name by the staff. The duck salad is her go-to. <br><br>So, Fed Ex... about that weekly delivery...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
