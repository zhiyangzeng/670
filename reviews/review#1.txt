<p itemprop="description" lang="en">This place is delicious, authentic, inside the loop, AND clean? It's just too good to be true!<br><br>My favorites are the goi vit (duck salad), bun bo hue (#16 spicy noodle soup), and com phuong hoang (phoenix chicken).<br><br>I'm Vietnamese and I've never had goi vit before and this dish was almost life changing! The bun bo hue is so flavorful, it doesn't even need the addition of shrimp paste (really!). The phoenix chicken is simple but delicious. <br><br>Other highlights are the bo luc lac (#57). I never order this dish at Vietnamese restaurants because it is always a disappointment. Nobody does it as well as my mom or the little hole in the wall restaurant up north where my mom borrowed the recipe. This place actually is able to stand up to the dish. I'm really amazed and almost a little sad. I can't necessarily say that you can only get the best bo luc lac from my mom's kitchen anymore.<br><br>The pho is also good, much better than any of the other pho places inside the loop.<br><br>Yes, the mi quang and goi cuon thit nuong are good too, but I think the other items totally outshine these. Oh, and my mom makes these dishes better anyway.<br><br>I'm slowly making my way down the menu and will update periodically. I'm so excited to have found a stellar Vietnamese restaurant close to me. <br><br>Another great thing about this place is that it's fast. They'll get your to-go orders done quickly, even if you're ordering for 15 people. They'll also get you in and out of lunch before your boss can get mad at you.<br><br>My only peeve is that they close on Sundays. So lame.<br><br>This place is legit. Don't miss out on this gem.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
