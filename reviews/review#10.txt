<p itemprop="description" lang="en">Delicious food, excellent service.<br><br>A few coworkers and I visited Huynh Restaurant around noon on a weekday.<br><br>We did not hear to wait long for a table, and our server was awesome.  He first recommended a great-tasting, different kind of tea, chrysanthemum tea.  Our server also brought out some sugar water that added to the taste of the tea.  I have to admit, tea made with flowers was quite good.<br><br>One of my coworkers ordered some pork and shrimp spring rolls, but the meat in the spring rolls had an old/gamey taste.  It didn't bother me much, but others at our table did not feel the same.<br><br>Our server (yes, I forgot his name) recommended several different dishes in multiple categories.  One of the dishes he recommended was the vegetarian coconut curry, but I wanted some meat, so opted for the shrimp and broccoli with coconut curry.<br><br>I asked our server how spicy their spicy level of heat was compared to Thai Gourmet.  He told us that Thai Gourmet's medium would be the equivalent of HRs spicy.  He was right on...I ordered spicy and it was not overpowering...just right for the curry.<br><br>Food crack!  I could not stop myself after I started eating the coconut curry.  This was some of the best curry I have ever had.  The large shrimp and broccoli was a great combination with the sauce.<br><br>As we left, we cleaned-out the mystery dum-dum lollipops from a bowl near the entrance.  Great way to top-off an awesome meal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
