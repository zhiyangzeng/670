<p itemprop="description" lang="en">Thank you to my sweetheart for introducing me to Huynh's! I absolutely adore this place. Probably one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in Houston. Parking can be a drag for the lot is a bit tight. It's a cozy establishment - makes me feel at home in a way. The servers are all very very sweet &amp; I find it impressive that even the non-vietnamese waiters know everything on the menu! <br><br>- Bo Ne (3/5): Doesn't compare to the Bo Ne in bellaire, but every restaurant has their own version. It's always served in a cow shaped cast iron skillet. The dish was tasty but everything was greasy. Comes with a sunny side up egg, a thin slab of steak, Chinese sausage &amp; banh mi. Only served on Saturdays for lunch if I'm not mistaken. <br><br>- Banh Uot Thit Nuong (3/5): Chargrilled pork wrapped in thick &amp; spongy rice paper. It was a simple appetizer. Nothing really to rave about. I'm just not a big fan of the mint. The dipping sauce is amazing though! <br><br>- Mi Quang (3/5): Comes with very little soup - which is how it's suppose to be. The noodles were a bit undercooked.. But aside from that! The broth was great; very flavorful. The meats were cooked perfectly. The sesame cracker adds crunch &amp; don't forget to squeeze in the lime! <br><br>- Coconut Curry Tofu (5/5): One of the best curry dishes I've ever had. It was rich, creamy &amp; coconutty. Every piece of tofu were soaked in curry. The glass noodles were hidden underneath which I didn't find until almost the end. It also comes with a bowl of rice, but I prefer the noodles.<br><br>- FLAN (5/5): Jackpottttt. Found the best flan ever. I CRAVE for their flan. It's so smooth &amp; has just the right amount of sweetness + bitterness from the Vietnamese coffee. It comes in the size of my palm with a scoop of crushed ice on top.<br><br>Also, for really cold or sick days - get the PANDAN hot tea!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
