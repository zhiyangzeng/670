<p itemprop="description" lang="en">We were craving for Vietnamese places near where we were staying and stumbled upon this restaurant thanks to yelp. Plus we didn't feel like driving all the way to Chinatown/Bellaire. I was really surprised when I stepped foot into the restaurant because of how CLEAN and decorated the place was. Vietnamese restaurants usually look run down with crappy services but Huynh was definitely an exception. We actually saw our waiter more than once! Regardless of that, I was so glad we decided to eat here because I loved it.<br><br>One of the popular items is the banh uot which is this thick rice paper rolled with whatever stuffing people choose to (think of it a thicker banh cuon). We had the one with chargrilled pork and I love it! I haven't found a place in DFW to my knowledge that serves banh uot so this was my first time trying it. The sauce that came with it complemented the banh uot very well. Our next dish was this sizzling fried eggs that came out on a hot plate (like the fajita ones). This reminded me of my favorite dish that my dad made for us in the morning so I felt nostalgia as I was eating this. Bread comes with the entree and it is to be dipped with the eggs. SO GOOD. <br><br>For our actual entrees, I had spicy bun bo hue while my boyfriend had banh cuon. Let me tell you, it is hard in DFW to find good bun bo hue and I have no idea why. Their bun bo hue definitely hit the spot with the right amount of spiciness and flavor. I could eat bun bo hue every week if I could. I also thought the banh cuon was also pretty good. The rice paper was thin and there was enough meat in each rolls.<br><br>Love this place and I'll definitely be back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
