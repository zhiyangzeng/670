<p itemprop="description" lang="en">450+ reviews &amp; 4 stars for a Vietnamese restaurant? I was skeptical at first thinking the place would be more Americanized to cater to the downtown crowd. After my visit, this is not entirely true. <br><br>#5 BÁNH UOT THIT NUONG - not your traditional banh uot. The steamed rice batter is wrapped around the pork and lettuce - somewhat similar to banh cuon but with thicker rice batter. "Special sauce" was a little weird consistency and color. I would rather have it with nuoc mam (fish sauce) next time. <br><br>#94 MÌ QUANG - Really good! The broth is not too salty, and there's just the right amount of meat, veggies, and crackers. Don't forget to squeeze the lime first before indulging! TIP: This soup is not your typical pho bowl because there's very little broth so be sure you understand what you're ordering. <br><br>#82 ÐU HU XÀO LĂN - basically fried tofu, thick, creamy coconut curry sauce with clear glass noodles. I found it pretty interesting because they served it with rice but there was already noodles in the dish. I loved the flavors but wished the tofu soaked up more of the curry flavor. Again, another dish you should review before ordering.<br><br>#D3 FLAN - flan + Vietnamese coffee? The sweetness of the flan with the strong, bitter coffee makes the perfect pair. I devoured every single bit of it. Next time I could opt for no shaved ice though :) <br><br>4 stars for the food - 1 star for the service. I know what kind of service to expect at Vietnamese restaurants, but Huynh is not your typical Bellaire joint so the waiters shouldn't treat their customers like a typical Bellaire joint. <br><br>Other than the service, I would return solely for their food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></p>
